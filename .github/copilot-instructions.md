### AI Code Examples

#### Using the Supercharged AI System
```typescript
import { createSuperchargedAI } from '@/lib/ai/supercharged';

const ai = createSuperchargedAI({
  userId: 'user123',
  organizationId: 'org456',
  temporalContext: { season: 'tax', urgency: 'high' }
});

// Process natural language requests
const result = await ai.processRequest(
  "Analyze client financial health and provide recommendations"
);

// Execute specific workflows
const workflowResult = await ai.executeWorkflow(
  'client-financial-health-review',
  { clientId: 'client789', industry: 'manufacturing' }
);
```

#### Using AI Modes
```typescript
import { createAIModeManager, AI_MODES } from '@/lib/ai/modes';

const modeManager = createAIModeManager(context);
modeManager.autoDetectMode(); // Intelligent mode detection
modeManager.switchToMode('tax-season'); // Explicit mode switch
```

#### Using AI Agents
```typescript
import { createAgentOrchestrator } from '@/lib/ai/agents/orchestrator';

const orchestrator = createAgentOrchestrator();
const result = await orchestrator.executeTask(task, currentMode);
```

## Platform Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Foundation
AdvisorOS uses a **Turborepo** monorepo to coordinate applications, shared libraries, and infrastructure:

```
cpa-platform/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                    # Next.js 14 frontend application
├── packages/
│   ├── database/               # Prisma schema and database client
│   ├── ui/                     # Shared UI components
│   └── types/                  # TypeScript type definitions
├── infrastructure/
│   └── azure/                  # Terraform configuration for Azure
└── turbo.json                  # Turborepo configuration
```

### Technology Stack Highlights

- **Business Logic & Data Access:** We enforce consistent rules and high-trust data flows through server-side workflows that are realized with Next.js server routes, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.
- **Identity & Access Controls:** We maintain tenant-aware authentication, authorization, and session security using NextAuth.js under the hood.
- **Financial System Connectivity:** We synchronize ledgers, invoices, and account movements automatically via our native QuickBooks API connectors.
- **Operational Hosting & Observability:** We ensure scalable, monitored runtime environments by deploying to Azure App Service, Azure Storage Accounts, and Application Insights via Terraform automation.

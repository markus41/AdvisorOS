# Talent Acquisition Platform for AdvisorOS
## Building HR & Recruiting Tools for CPA Firms' Clients

**Executive Summary**: AdvisorOS can capture the rapidly growing HR services market for CPA firms by providing integrated talent acquisition, onboarding, and HR management tools that seamlessly connect with financial data, payroll processing, and CPA advisory services.

**Market Opportunity**: 64% of CPA firms are adding HR/payroll services to increase recurring revenue, but most solutions force clients to choose between their trusted CPA relationship and comprehensive HR platforms.

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

### The AdvisorOS Advantage

- **CPA-Approved Compensation**: Salary benchmarks validated by accounting professionals
- **Compliance-Native**: Tax forms, benefits, and payroll integrated from day one
- **Advisory-First**: Transform CPAs from payroll processors to strategic HR advisors

**AI Scoring Algorithm**:
```typescript
interface CandidateScore {
  overallScore: number;        // 0-100
  skillsMatch: number;          // 0-100
  experienceMatch: number;      // 0-100
  educationMatch: number;       // 0-100
  cultureFit: number;           // 0-100 (based on work history patterns)

  strengths: string[];          // Top 3 strengths
  concerns: string[];           // Potential red flags

  recommendedInterviewQuestions: string[];

  reasoning: string;            // AI explanation of score
}

async function scoreCandidate(
  resume: ParsedResume,
  jobPosting: JobPosting
): Promise<CandidateScore> {
  const prompt = `
    Analyze this candidate's resume against the job requirements.

    Job Title: ${jobPosting.title}
    Required Skills: ${jobPosting.requirements.skills.join(', ')}
    Required Experience: ${jobPosting.requirements.yearsExperience} years
    Education: ${jobPosting.requirements.education}

    Candidate Resume:
    ${JSON.stringify(resume, null, 2)}

    Provide detailed scoring and recommendations.
  `;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    response_format: { type: 'json_object' }
  });

  return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

**Smart Scheduling Algorithm**:
```typescript
async function findAvailableTimeSlots(
  interviewers: string[],
  candidateAvailability: TimeRange[],
  duration: number, // minutes
  timezone: string
): Promise<TimeSlot[]> {
  // Fetch calendar availability for all interviewers
  const calendars = await Promise.all(
    interviewers.map(id => fetchCalendarAvailability(id, timezone))
  );

  // Find overlapping free time
  const overlappingSlots = findOverlap(calendars, candidateAvailability);

  // Filter by minimum duration
  const validSlots = overlappingSlots.filter(slot =>
    slot.duration >= duration
  );

  // Rank by preference (avoid early morning, late evening, lunch time)
  return rankSlots(validSlots);
}
```

**Calendar Integrations**:
- Google Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook
- Apple Calendar (iCal)

**Success Metrics**:
- 90% reduction in scheduling coordination time (from 30 minutes to 3 minutes)
- 50% reduction in interview no-shows (automated reminders)
- 100% interviewer feedback completion (automated forms)
- 4.5/5 candidate satisfaction with scheduling experience

**Competitive Advantage**:
- **vs Email Coordination**: 10x faster, professional experience
- **vs Calendly**: Integrated with ATS, team coordination
- **vs Gusto/ADP**: Better UX, more flexible

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Infrastructure Costs (Estimated)

| Component | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Primary Database** | GP_Standard_D4s_v3 + 256GB | $600 |
| **Read Replica 1** | GP_Standard_D4s_v3 + 256GB | $600 |
| **DR Replica** (optional) | GP_Standard_D4s_v3 + 256GB | $600 |
| **Cross-Region Transfer** (DR only) | ~10GB/day | $50 |
| **Application Insights** | 10GB/month | $20 |
| **Log Analytics** | 10GB/month | $30 |
| **Dashboards & Alerts** | Included | $0 |
| **Key Vault** | Standard tier | $5 |

**Total Monthly Cost:**
- **Without DR Replica**: ~$1,255/month
- **With DR Replica**: ~$1,905/month

### Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Development/Staging**: Use smaller SKUs (B_Standard_B2s)
2. **Production Scaling**: Monitor usage and adjust SKU as needed
3. **Storage Optimization**: Review data retention policies
4. **Monitoring**: Adjust sampling rates for Application Insights
5. **DR Replica**: Enable only if cross-region redundancy required

## Performance Expectations

### Replication Performance

| Metric | Same-Region (Replica 1) | Cross-Region (DR) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Typical Lag | 1-3 seconds | 10-30 seconds |
| Maximum Acceptable | 10 seconds | 60 seconds |
| Network Latency | < 5ms | 30-50ms |
| Throughput | 10,000+ TPS | 5,000+ TPS |

### Query Performance

| Query Type | Primary | Replica 1 | Improvement |
|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Simple SELECT | 5ms | 5ms | 0% |
| Complex Analytics | 200ms | 180ms | 10% |
| Large Aggregations | 1000ms | 900ms | 10% |
| Concurrent Reads | Degraded | Improved | 40% |

**Benefits of Read Replicas:**
- **Reduced primary load**: 40-50% reduction in read queries
- **Improved write performance**: 20-30% improvement due to reduced contention
- **Better user experience**: Faster response times for read-heavy operations
- **Scalability**: Can add more replicas as needed

## Next Steps & Integration

### Application Integration

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Add to application configuration
   DATABASE_URL=<primary-connection-string>
   DATABASE_READONLY_URL=<replica-1-connection-string>
   ```

2. **Implement Read/Write Routing**
   ```typescript
   // Example routing logic
   const writeDb = new Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
   const readDb = new Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_READONLY_URL });

   // Writes go to primary
   await writeDb.query('INSERT INTO ...');

   // Reads go to replica
   const data = await readDb.query('SELECT * FROM ...');
   ```

3. **Test Failover Scenarios**
   - Simulate primary failure
   - Test read replica promotion
   - Verify application handles replication lag

### Database Optimizer Coordination

**Handoff to database-optimizer agent:**

The infrastructure is now ready for the database-optimizer agent to implement:
1. Connection routing logic (`apps/web/src/lib/database/replica-router.ts`)
2. Query classification (read vs write)
3. Connection pool management for replicas
4. Replication lag handling
5. Performance monitoring integration

**Integration Points:**
- Connection strings available in Key Vault
- Replica endpoints operational
- Monitoring configured for query performance
- Alerts configured for replication issues

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Configure Alert Recipients**
   ```bash
   # Update alert email in prod.tfvars
   alert_email = "ops-team@advisoros.com"
   ```

2. **Set Up Notification Channels**
   - Email notifications (configured)
   - Slack/Teams webhook (update monitoring.tf)
   - PagerDuty integration (recommended for production)

3. **Review Dashboards**
   - Customize dashboard layouts
   - Add additional metrics as needed
   - Share with operations team

### Performance Testing

1. **Baseline Metrics**
   - Record current query performance
   - Document application response times
   - Measure primary database load

2. **Load Testing**
   - Test read queries on replicas
   - Measure replication lag under load
   - Verify alert thresholds

3. **Optimization**
   - Adjust connection pool sizes
   - Tune query routing logic
   - Monitor and optimize replica performance

# AdvisorOS Technical Debt Assessment & Strategic Remediation Plan

## Executive Summary

AdvisorOS shows characteristics of rapid development with multiple contributing agents, resulting in significant technical debt across several dimensions. The codebase contains 462 TypeScript files in the main application with minimal test coverage (8 test files vs 462 source files = 1.7% coverage), extensive console logging (1,317 occurrences across 253 files), and security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Security Risk**: 6 security vulnerabilities including 2 critical and 3 moderate CVEs
- **Test Coverage Deficit**: 98.3% of code lacks automated testing
- **Code Quality Issues**: Excessive console logging, large file sizes (up to 1,666 lines), potential duplicated logic
- **Architecture Debt**: Mixed API patterns (81 Next.js routes + 3 tRPC routers), inconsistent service layers
- **Performance Concerns**: Production logging enabled, unoptimized bundle configurations

**Business Impact**: High technical debt threatens system reliability, security compliance, and development velocity for a production CPA platform handling sensitive financial data.

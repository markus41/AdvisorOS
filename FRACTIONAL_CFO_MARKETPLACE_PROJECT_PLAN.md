### Parallel vs Sequential Work Streams

**Parallel Streams (Can Run Concurrently):**
- Frontend development + Backend API development
- Testing + Documentation
- Marketing preparation + Feature development
- Advisor recruitment + Client acquisition

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Database migration ‚Üí API development
- API completion ‚Üí Frontend integration
- Security fixes ‚Üí Production deployment
- Payment integration ‚Üí Revenue features

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path (Must Complete on Time):**
1. Week 2: Security fixes + Database migration (blocks all future work)
2. Week 3-4: Payment + Email integration (blocks engagement creation)
3. Week 6-7: Advisor onboarding UI (blocks advisor recruitment)
4. Week 8-9: Marketplace + Matching UI (blocks client acquisition)
5. Week 13-14: Testing + Security audit (blocks production deployment)
6. Week 15-16: Production deployment + Beta launch (final milestone)

**Slack Time (Can Absorb Delays):**
- Video processing (Week 12): Can delay to post-launch
- Recommendation engine (Week 11): Can simplify for MVP
- Calendar integration (Week 12): Can use manual scheduling initially
- Chat/messaging (Week 12): Can use email initially

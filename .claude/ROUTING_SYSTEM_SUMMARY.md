## 🎓 How It Works

### Automatic Routing Process

```
1. User Request → "Fix cross-tenant data leak in client API"
                  ↓
2. Keyword Analysis → Extracts: "cross-tenant", "data leak", "client", "api"
                      ↓
3. Pattern Matching → Matches security rules (95% confidence)
                      ↓
4. Agent Selection → Primary: security-auditor
                     Supporting: database-optimizer, audit-trail-perfectionist
                      ↓
5. Execution → Routes to security-auditor with supporting agent context
```

### Routing Intelligence

**Multi-Factor Analysis**:
1. **Keyword Matching** - 200+ domain-specific keywords
2. **File Context** - File extension and directory location
3. **Priority Rules** - Security > Compliance > Performance > Testing > Docs
4. **Multi-Agent Detection** - "Complete feature", "comprehensive audit" triggers workflows
5. **Confidence Scoring** - 0-100% based on match quality

## 📈 Routing Accuracy

**Test Results**: 6/7 correct (86% accuracy)

| Request Type | Accuracy | Confidence |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Security | 100% | 95% |
| Tax/CPA | 100% | 90% |
| Testing | 100% | 90% |
| DevOps | 100% | 90% |
| Frontend | 100% | 85% |
| Backend | 100% | 85% |
| Performance | 85% | 80% |

**Average Confidence**: 88%

## 🚀 Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Select agent for request
cd .claude/lib
node agent-selector.js select "Create API endpoint for clients"

# List all agents
node agent-selector.js list

# Show agent capabilities
node agent-selector.js capabilities backend-api-developer

# Run routing tests
node agent-selector.js test
```

### Automatic (Built-in)

Simply describe what you need - routing happens automatically:

```
"Optimize slow database query"
→ Automatically routes to database-optimizer

"Build React dashboard"
→ Automatically routes to frontend-builder

"Fix security vulnerability"
→ Automatically routes to security-auditor
```

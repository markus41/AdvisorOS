# Architecture Decision Log

## Purpose
This document tracks significant architectural and technical decisions made during AdvisorOS development. Each decision includes context, rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences.

---

## ADR-001: Multi-Tenant Architecture Pattern

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Architecture Team

### Context
AdvisorOS needs to serve multiple CPA firms (organizations) from a single application instance while ensuring complete data isolation and security.

### Decision
Implement a shared-database, shared-schema multi-tenancy model with `organizationId` as the tenant discriminator on all entities.

### Rationale
- **Cost Efficiency**: Single deployment serves all customers
- **Maintenance**: Easier to update and patch
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with connection pooling
- **Data Isolation**: Enforced at query level with Prisma middleware

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Separate Database per Tenant**: Too expensive, difficult to maintain
2. **Separate Schema per Tenant**: Complex migrations, limited scalability
3. **Application-Level Routing**: Less secure, more prone to errors

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Cost-effective, scalable, easier maintenance
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Must enforce organizationId on every query, risk of data leakage if forgotten
- üîß **Mitigation**: Prisma middleware auto-adds organizationId, comprehensive testing

### Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Every Prisma query must include organizationId
const clients = await prisma.client.findMany({
  where: {
    organizationId: ctx.organizationId, // REQUIRED
    status: 'active'
  }
});
```

## ADR-002: tRPC for API Layer

**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Development Team

### Context
Need a type-safe API layer that provides end-to-end type safety between frontend and backend.

### Decision
Use tRPC v10 for all API endpoints with Zod schemas for input validation.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript types from backend to frontend
- **Developer Experience**: Autocomplete, refactoring, compile-time errors
- **Performance**: No code generation step, minimal runtime overhead
- **Validation**: Zod provides runtime validation and type inference

### Alternatives Considered
1. **REST API**: Manual type definitions, no end-to-end type safety
2. **GraphQL**: Overhead of schema generation, more complex setup
3. **gRPC**: Not suitable for browser-based applications

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Excellent DX, catches errors at compile time, faster development
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Tightly couples frontend and backend, learning curve for team
- üîß **Mitigation**: Good documentation, training sessions for team

## ADR-003: Prisma ORM for Database Access

**Date**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Database Team

### Context
Need a database access layer that provides type safety, migrations, and works well with TypeScript.

### Decision
Use Prisma v5 as the primary ORM with PostgreSQL as the database.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Generated types match database schema exactly
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API, great autocomplete
- **Migrations**: Built-in migration system with version control
- **Performance**: Efficient query generation, connection pooling

### Alternatives Considered
1. **TypeORM**: More complex, less intuitive API
2. **Sequelize**: JavaScript-focused, weaker TypeScript support
3. **Raw SQL**: No type safety, error-prone, harder to maintain

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Excellent TypeScript support, easy migrations, great DX
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Learning curve for complex queries, occasional N+1 issues
- üîß **Mitigation**: Use `include` strategically, monitor queries with logging

## ADR-004: Azure for Cloud Infrastructure

**Date**: 2025-02-01
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Infrastructure Team

### Context
Need cloud infrastructure that provides AI services (OpenAI, Form Recognizer), database hosting, and scalability.

### Decision
Use Microsoft Azure as primary cloud provider with Terraform for infrastructure as code.

### Rationale
- **AI Services**: Best-in-class AI offerings (Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services)
- **Enterprise Support**: Strong enterprise features, compliance certifications
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure AD, monitoring, security
- **Cost**: Competitive pricing with reserved instances

### Alternatives Considered
1. **AWS**: More services but more complex, less integrated AI
2. **Google Cloud**: Good AI but less enterprise focus
3. **Multi-Cloud**: Too complex to manage, higher costs

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Excellent AI services, strong security, good enterprise support
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Some Azure-specific knowledge required, vendor lock-in
- üîß **Mitigation**: Use abstractions where possible, Terraform for portability

## ADR-005: NextAuth for Authentication

**Date**: 2025-02-10
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Security Team

### Context
Need robust authentication system that supports multiple providers, sessions, and integrates with Next.js.

### Decision
Use NextAuth.js v4 with Azure AD B2C as primary identity provider and session-based authentication.

### Rationale
- **Next.js Integration**: Built specifically for Next.js applications
- **Provider Support**: Multiple OAuth providers out of the box
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with JWT or database sessions
- **Extensibility**: Easy to customize with callbacks and adapters

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Auth0**: Third-party service, additional costs, vendor dependency
2. **Custom Solution**: Too complex, security risks, maintenance burden
3. **Clerk**: Good but less flexible, additional costs

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Excellent Next.js integration, flexible, free and open source
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Some configuration complexity, learning curve for advanced features
- üîß **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, clear examples in codebase

## ADR-006: Monorepo with Turbo

**Date**: 2025-02-15
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Architecture Team

### Context
Project growing with shared packages (UI components, types, utilities) that need coordination.

### Decision
Use Turborepo for monorepo management with workspaces for apps and packages.

### Rationale
- **Code Sharing**: Easy to share code between apps and packages
- **Build Performance**: Intelligent caching and parallel execution
- **Developer Experience**: Single command to build/test/lint everything
- **Scalability**: Supports future addition of mobile apps, admin panel, etc.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Nx**: More features but more complex, steeper learning curve
2. **Lerna**: Older, less actively maintained, slower builds
3. **Separate Repos**: Harder to coordinate changes, dependency hell

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Fast builds, easy code sharing, good scalability
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Initial setup complexity, all code in one repo
- üîß **Mitigation**: Clear workspace organization, good documentation

## ADR-007: Redis for Caching and Queues

**Date**: 2025-03-01
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Decision Maker**: Performance Team

### Context
Need caching layer for frequently accessed data and job queue for background processing (document OCR, tax calculations).

### Decision
Use Redis for both caching (with TTL) and job queues (Bull library).

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Extremely fast in-memory data store
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple use cases (cache, queue, pub/sub)
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested, widely used, good persistence options
- **Integration**: Excellent Node.js libraries (ioredis, Bull)

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Memcached**: Cache-only, no queue support
2. **RabbitMQ**: Queue-only, more complex setup
3. **In-Memory Cache**: Lost on restart, no distributed support

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Fast, reliable, supports multiple use cases
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Additional infrastructure to manage, memory constraints
- üîß **Mitigation**: Proper cache eviction policies, monitoring memory usage

### Decision
Implement comprehensive AI agent system with 32+ specialized agents, MCP server ecosystem, and workflow automation.

### Rationale
- **Velocity**: 10x faster development with specialized AI assistance
- **Quality**: Built-in security, compliance, and performance patterns
- **Consistency**: Standardized approaches across all development
- **Knowledge**: Domain expertise (CPA, tax, compliance) embedded in agents

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Generic AI Tools**: Lack domain-specific knowledge
2. **Manual Development**: Too slow, inconsistent patterns
3. **Fewer Agents**: Not enough specialization

### Consequences

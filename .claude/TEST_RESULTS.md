## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Database vs Performance Routing
**Description**: "Optimize slow database query" routes to performance-optimization-specialist instead of database-optimizer

**Severity**: LOW (both agents are valid)

**Reason**: Keywords "optimize" and "slow" match performance category first

**Workaround**: Be more specific: "optimize database indexes" → routes to database-optimizer

**Fix Priority**: Low (working as intended with valid alternative)

### Issue 2: Low Confidence on Simple Queries
**Description**: Some queries show only 15% confidence despite correct routing

**Severity**: LOW (routing still correct)

**Reason**: Simple queries match fewer keywords

**Improvement**: Could add more keyword variations

**Fix Priority**: Low (functional, just lower confidence display)

# Cost Estimate: AI-Powered Tax Document Analysis

## Usage Assumptions
- 1,000 documents per month
- Average 5 pages per document
- 90% invoice/receipt, 10% tax forms
- Real-time processing required
- 3-year historical data retention

## Monthly Cost Breakdown

### Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Document classification: $45
  * 1,000 docs × 500 tokens × $0.03/1K tokens = $15
  * Analysis summary: 1,000 docs × 1,000 tokens × $0.03/1K tokens = $30
- Embeddings for search: $5
  * 1,000 docs × 500 tokens × $0.0001/1K tokens = $0.05
  * Monthly total: $45

### Azure Form Recognizer
- Invoice processing: $1,350
  * 900 invoices × 5 pages × $0.30/page = $1,350
- Tax form processing: $150
  * 100 tax forms × 5 pages × $0.30/page = $150
- Monthly total: $1,500

### Storage (Azure Blob)
- Document storage: $20
  * 1,000 docs × 2MB average × $0.02/GB = $0.04/month
  * 3-year retention: 36,000 docs × 2MB = 72GB × $0.02 = $1.44
  * With redundancy (GRS): $20/month
- Monthly total: $20

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- Additional document metadata: $5
  * Minimal impact on existing database
- Monthly total: $5

### Bandwidth
- Document upload/download: $10
  * 1,000 docs × 2MB × 2 (upload + download) × $0.005/GB = $0.02
  * Included in free tier, minimal cost
- Monthly total: $10

## Total Monthly Cost: $1,580

## Annual Cost: $18,960

## Cost Per Document: $1.58

## Scaling Analysis

| Documents/Month | Monthly Cost | Per Document |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 500             | $790         | $1.58        |
| 1,000           | $1,580       | $1.58        |
| 5,000           | $7,900       | $1.58        |
| 10,000          | $15,800      | $1.58        |

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

1. **Batch Processing** (Save ~20%)
   - Process documents in batches during off-peak hours
   - Savings: $316/month

2. **Caching** (Save ~15%)
   - Cache Form Recognizer results for similar documents
   - Savings: $237/month

3. **Tiered Processing** (Save ~30%)
   - Use simple OCR for receipts, advanced AI only for complex forms
   - Savings: $474/month

4. **Reserved Capacity** (Save ~25%)
   - Purchase Azure reserved instances for predictable workload
   - Savings: $395/month

## Total Potential Savings: $1,422/month (90% reduction)
## Optimized Monthly Cost: $158

## Recommendations

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Begin with 500 documents/month pilot
   - Monitor actual usage vs. estimates
   - Scale gradually based on adoption

2. **Implement Optimization Early**
   - Caching from day one
   - Batch processing where possible
   - Consider reserved instances after 3 months

3. **Monitor Continuously**
   - Set up cost alerts at $1,200/month
   - Weekly cost review dashboards
   - Track cost per document metric

4. **Alternative Approach**
   - Consider cheaper OCR services for simple documents
   - Use Azure OpenAI only for complex analysis
   - Estimated savings: 60%

## Risk Factors

- Document complexity higher than expected: +30% cost
- Higher adoption rate: Linear scaling
- Azure price changes: Monitor quarterly
- Additional features (e.g., translation): +$200/month

## ROI Analysis

Assuming $5/document pricing to clients:
- Revenue: $5,000/month (1,000 docs)
- Cost: $158/month (optimized)
- Gross Margin: 97%
- Payback Period: Immediate

## Next Steps

1. Enable Azure cost tracking
2. Implement cost optimization strategies
3. Set up monitoring dashboards
4. Review costs monthly
5. Adjust pricing based on actual costs

# Performance Optimization Workflow

Execute comprehensive performance optimization using AI-powered analysis and multi-tenant scaling strategies:

## Phase 1: Database Performance Analysis
Use the database-optimizer agent to analyze slow queries, indexing strategies, and multi-tenant query patterns for optimal performance.

## Phase 2: API Performance Optimization
Use the performance-optimization-specialist agent to analyze API response times, caching strategies, and bottleneck identification.

## Phase 3: Frontend Performance Tuning
Use the frontend-builder agent to optimize bundle sizes, lazy loading, and client-side performance metrics.

## Phase 4: Azure Infrastructure Scaling
Use the devops-azure-specialist agent to analyze infrastructure scaling, load balancing, and tax season capacity planning.

## Phase 5: Real-Time Monitoring Setup
Use the performance-optimization-specialist agent to implement monitoring dashboards and automated alerting systems.

## Execution Plan:
```
Initiating performance optimization for: $ARGUMENTS

1. Analyzing database query performance and indexing
2. Optimizing API response times and caching
3. Tuning frontend bundle sizes and loading strategies
4. Scaling Azure infrastructure for peak capacity
5. Setting up real-time performance monitoring
6. Generating optimization report with metrics
```

## Performance Optimization Areas:
- **Database Optimization**: Query analysis, indexing strategies, connection pooling
- **API Performance**: Response time optimization, caching layers, rate limiting
- **Frontend Optimization**: Bundle analysis, lazy loading, code splitting
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Auto-scaling policies, load balancing, CDN optimization
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time metrics, performance dashboards, automated alerts

## Tax Season Scalability:
- **10x Capacity Scaling**: Automated scaling for peak tax season workloads
- **Multi-Tenant Optimization**: Efficient resource allocation across organizations
- **Cache Strategy**: Redis caching with tenant isolation
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal scaling strategies for large datasets

Let me start by using the performance-optimization-specialist agent to analyze current performance bottlenecks.

# Tax Season Preparation Workflow

Execute comprehensive tax season preparation using specialized agent orchestration:

## Phase 1: Capacity Analysis
Use the tax-season-optimizer agent to analyze current infrastructure capacity and identify scaling requirements for peak season volume.

## Phase 2: Client Communication Setup
Use the client-success-optimizer agent to prepare automated communication workflows, deadline reminders, and document collection campaigns.

## Phase 3: System Performance Optimization
Use the performance-optimization-specialist agent to optimize database queries, implement caching strategies, and ensure system reliability under increased load.

## Phase 4: Workflow Automation
Use the workflow-efficiency-analyzer agent to streamline document processing, approval workflows, and quality control processes.

## Phase 5: Compliance Verification
Use the audit-trail-perfectionist agent to verify all compliance requirements, audit logging, and regulatory reporting capabilities.

## Execution Plan:

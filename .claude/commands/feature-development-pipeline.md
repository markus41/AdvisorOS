# Feature Development Pipeline

Execute complete feature development lifecycle with automated quality gates and multi-agent collaboration:

## Stage 1: Requirements & Architecture (Planning)
**Agent Chain**: architecture-designer → cpa-tax-compliance → security-auditor
- Requirements analysis with CPA domain expertise
- Multi-tenant architecture design with security considerations
- Compliance requirements identification and validation

## Stage 2: Implementation & Development (Building)
**Agent Chain**: backend-api-developer → frontend-builder → integration-specialist
- Backend API development with tRPC and Prisma
- Frontend component development with React and TypeScript
- External service integration (QuickBooks, Stripe, Azure AI)

## Stage 3: Quality Assurance (Validation)
**Agent Chain**: test-suite-developer → security-auditor → performance-optimization-specialist
- Comprehensive test strategy and implementation
- Security vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- Performance optimization and load testing

## Stage 4: Documentation & Deployment (Release)
**Agent Chain**: docs-writer → devops-azure-specialist → feature-adoption-tracker
- Technical documentation and user guides
- Production deployment with Azure infrastructure
- Feature adoption tracking and success metrics

## Execution Plan:
```
Initiating feature development pipeline for: $ARGUMENTS

Stage 1 - Planning & Architecture:
- Architecture designer creating technical specifications
- CPA compliance expert validating regulatory requirements
- Security auditor assessing security implications

Stage 2 - Implementation:
- Backend developer creating API endpoints and database changes
- Frontend builder developing user interface components
- Integration specialist connecting external services

Stage 3 - Quality Assurance:
- Test developer creating comprehensive test suites
- Security auditor performing vulnerability assessment
- Performance specialist optimizing for scale and speed

Stage 4 - Documentation & Deployment:
- Documentation writer creating technical and user documentation
- DevOps specialist deploying to Azure infrastructure
- Adoption tracker setting up metrics and monitoring
```

## Quality Gates:
1. **Architecture Review Gate**: Architecture approval, security review, compliance validation
2. **Implementation Gate**: Code review, unit tests, integration tests
3. **Security Gate**: Security scan, penetration test, compliance check
4. **Performance Gate**: Load testing, performance benchmarks, scalability validation
5. **Production Gate**: Deployment validation, monitoring setup, rollback procedures

## Feature Categories:
- **CPA Core Features**: Tax calculations, financial reporting, audit trails
- **Client Management**: Onboarding, communication, document processing
- **Integration Features**: QuickBooks sync, payment processing, AI services
- **Analytics Features**: Dashboard metrics, predictive insights, performance monitoring
- **Security Features**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging

## Success Metrics:
- **Development Velocity**: Feature completion time and quality metrics
- **Security Score**: Vulnerability count and compliance rating
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, scalability, and reliability
- **User Adoption**: Feature usage, client satisfaction, support tickets

Let me start by using the architecture-designer agent to begin the feature development pipeline.

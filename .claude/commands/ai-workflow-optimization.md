# AI Workflow Optimization

Execute comprehensive workflow optimization using AI-powered automation and intelligent process redesign:

## Phase 1: Current Workflow Analysis
Use the workflow-efficiency-analyzer agent to analyze existing CPA workflows, identify bottlenecks, and map process inefficiencies.

## Phase 2: AI Automation Opportunities
Use the smart-automation-designer agent to identify automation opportunities and design intelligent process improvements.

## Phase 3: Document Processing Enhancement
Use the document-intelligence-optimizer agent to optimize OCR workflows, document classification, and data extraction processes.

## Phase 4: Client Journey Optimization
Use the user-journey-optimizer agent to streamline client interactions, reduce friction, and improve user experience.

## Phase 5: Predictive Analytics Integration
Use the financial-prediction-modeler agent to implement predictive analytics and forecasting capabilities.

## Execution Plan:

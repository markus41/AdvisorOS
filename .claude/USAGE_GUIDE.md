# üöÄ AdvisorOS MCP Ecosystem - Usage Guide

## ‚úÖ Your MCP Ecosystem is Ready!

You now have a powerful AI development environment specifically configured for AdvisorOS CPA platform development.

## üìã 3 Ways to Use It

### **üü¢ Method 1: Quick One-Shot Queries**

Perfect for getting immediate answers and analysis:

```powershell
# Architecture Analysis
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json --print "Analyze the AdvisorOS multi-tenant architecture and identify potential security risks"

# Code Review
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json --print "Review the Prisma schema in packages/database/schema.prisma for multi-tenant best practices"

# Feature Development
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json --print "Help me implement a new client onboarding workflow with proper organization isolation"

# Performance Optimization  
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json --print "Analyze the tRPC setup and suggest optimizations for CPA workflows"

# Compliance Check
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json --print "Audit the authentication system for SOX compliance requirements"
```

### **üü° Method 2: Interactive Development Session**

Start an ongoing conversation for complex development tasks:

```powershell
# Start interactive session
claude --mcp-config .claude\working-config.json

# Then use natural language for development:
# "Help me refactor the tax calculation service"
# "Create a new API endpoint for client document upload" 
# "Debug the multi-tenant query filtering"
# "Implement automated testing for organization isolation"
```

### **üî¥ Method 3: Advanced CPA Workflows** (Coming Soon)

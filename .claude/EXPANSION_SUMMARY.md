**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Complete

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully expanded AdvisorOS's `.claude` ecosystem with **enterprise-grade AI capabilities** that vastly improve development velocity, code quality, security, and compliance.

## 📊 What Was Built

### 1. Context Enrichment System (`.claude/context/`)

#### [project-memory.json](context/project-memory.json)
**Purpose**: Persistent project state and knowledge across AI sessions

**Contents**:
- Complete tech stack inventory
- Current feature status and blockers
- Architecture patterns and critical paths
- Performance targets and optimization strategies
- Security principles and compliance requirements
- Team knowledge and conventions
- AI agent workflows and usage patterns
- Context hints for common patterns
- Quick wins for optimization, security, and quality
- Project metadata (agents, commands, coverage stats)

**Impact**: Agents now have instant access to project context without needing to search codebase.

#### [decision-log.md](context/decision-log.md)
**Purpose**: Architectural Decision Records (ADR) with full context

**8 Documented Decisions**:
1. Multi-Tenant Architecture Pattern (organizationId scoping)
2. tRPC for API Layer (end-to-end type safety)
3. Prisma ORM for Database Access (TypeScript integration)
4. Azure for Cloud Infrastructure (AI services focus)
5. NextAuth for Authentication (Next.js integration)

7. Redis for Caching and Queues (versatility)
8. Comprehensive AI Agent System (velocity + quality)

**Format**: Each decision includes context, rationale, alternatives considered, consequences, and implementation notes.

**Impact**: New developers understand *why* architectural decisions were made, not just *what* they are.

#### [code-patterns.yaml](context/code-patterns.yaml)
**Purpose**: Reusable code patterns with examples

**11 Documented Patterns**:
1. **Multi-Tenant Query** - organizationId filtering (CRITICAL)
2. **tRPC Procedure** - Type-safe API with validation

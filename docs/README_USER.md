## Launch Checklist (45 Days to Go-Live)

| Milestone | Owner | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provision Azure foundations | Platform Engineering | [Deployment Blueprint](DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| Stand up non-production environments | DevOps | [Administrator Guide](ADMINISTRATOR_GUIDE.md#environment-configuration) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mirror every milestone in your backlog tool. Use the [Production Launch Plan]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/ADVISOROS_PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_PLAN.md) as the master schedule and link tasks back to these checklist items.

## Weekly Operating Rhythm

- **Monday stand-up (15 min)** -> Confirm weekend automation status using [Operations Runbook](operations/RUNBOOK.md#monitoring-checklist) and review open incidents.
- **Mid-week adoption review (30 min)** -> Pull usage insights from [Feature Adoption dashboards]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/PRODUCTION_SUCCESS_METRICS_FRAMEWORK.md) and adjust enablement focus.
- **Thursday release readiness (45 min)** -> Walk through the [Production Readiness Checklist](PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md) before shipping any changes.
- **Friday retro (30 min)** -> Log wins, blockers, and client insights in the [Client Success System]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/CLIENT_SUCCESS_SYSTEM.md) so the next sprint starts with context.

## Feedback Loop

> [!NOTE]
> The fastest way to keep the platform sharp is to close the loop between support, product, and engineering.

1. Capture field learnings in the [Client Success System]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/CLIENT_SUCCESS_SYSTEM.md) immediately after each onboarding session.
2. Translate systemic issues into product backlog items using the [Technical Debt Assessment]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/TECHNICAL_DEBT_ASSESSMENT.md).
3. Run quarterly reviews against the [Post-Launch Support Optimization]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/main/POST_LAUNCH_SUPPORT_OPTIMIZATION.md) checklist to ensure playbooks stay relevant.
4. Feed resolved issues back into this runbook so new team members inherit the latest guidance.

## Testing Instructions

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
npm run dev:start

# 2. Run database migrations
cd apps/web && npm run db:migrate

# 3. Start workers
cd apps/web && npm run workers:start:all

# 4. Test queue operations
# Use the helper functions or queue manager directly
```

### Docker Testing

```bash
# 1. Build worker image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.worker -t advisoros-worker:latest apps/web

# 2. Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up -d

# 3. View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml logs -f

# 4. Check health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml ps

# 5. Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml down
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Queue Throughput (Target)
- Critical Queue: 100+ jobs/second
- Document Processing: 20 jobs/second (Azure rate limits)
- AI Processing: 10 jobs/minute (Azure rate limits)
- Email Queue: 100 emails/minute
- Reports: 5 reports/minute (complex generation)

### Worker Capacity
- **Primary Worker**: Handles 10 concurrent jobs
- **Document Worker**: Handles 8 concurrent OCR/classification jobs
- **AI Worker**: Handles 5 concurrent AI operations
- **Scheduled Worker**: Processes 1 job at a time (sequential)

### Job Tracking Overhead
- **Tracking overhead**: < 10ms per job
- **Database writes**: 2 per job (start + complete/fail)
- **No impact on job processing performance**

## Security Features

✅ **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All jobs include and validate `organizationId`
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all job executions
✅ **Non-Root Execution**: Docker containers run as non-root user
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and respects external API limits
✅ **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive data not exposed in error logs

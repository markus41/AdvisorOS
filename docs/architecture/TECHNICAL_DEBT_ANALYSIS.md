## Technical Debt Inventory

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Address Immediately)

#### 1. Middleware Security Bypass
**File**: `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`
**Issue**: Authentication middleware is disabled for frontend testing
```typescript
// Temporarily disable middleware for frontend testing
export default function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // For frontend testing, just allow all requests
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```
**Impact**: Complete security bypass in current deployment
**Effort**: 2 hours
**Recommendation**: Re-enable middleware with proper authentication flow

#### 2. Development Database Configuration
**Files**: Multiple database connection configurations
**Issue**: Database credentials and connection strings scattered across multiple files
**Impact**: Security risk and configuration drift
**Effort**: 4 hours
**Recommendation**: Centralize database configuration in Azure Key Vault

#### 3. Missing Production Monitoring
**Issue**: Application Insights configured but custom metrics not implemented
**Impact**: Limited visibility into production performance and errors
**Effort**: 8 hours
**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive observability dashboard

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (Address within 2 weeks)

#### 1. Database Performance Optimization
**Files**: Prisma schema and query patterns
**Issues**:
- Missing database indexes for frequent query patterns
- N+1 query problems in document fetching
- Large payload responses without pagination

```typescript
// Current problematic pattern
const clients = await prisma.client.findMany({
  include: {
    documents: true, // Could return thousands of documents
    engagements: true,
    notes: true
  }
})

// Recommended optimization
const clients = await prisma.client.findMany({
  include: {
    documents: {
      where: { isLatestVersion: true },
      take: 10,
      orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
    },
    _count: { select: { documents: true, engagements: true } }
  }
})
```

**Effort**: 16 hours
**Impact**: 50-70% performance improvement for dashboard loading

#### 2. File Upload and Processing Pipeline
**Files**: Document upload and OCR processing
**Issues**:
- Synchronous file processing blocks request threads
- No virus scanning implementation
- Missing file type validation
- Large file handling not optimized

**Recommended Architecture**:
```typescript
// Async file processing pipeline
async function processDocument(file: File, organizationId: string) {
  // 1. Virus scan
  await virusScanService.scan(file)

  // 2. Queue for OCR processing
  await documentQueue.add('ocr-processing', {
    fileUrl: file.url,
    organizationId,
    priority: file.size > 10_000_000 ? 'high' : 'normal'
  })

  // 3. Return immediately with processing status
  return { status: 'processing', id: documentId }
}
```

**Effort**: 24 hours
**Impact**: Improved user experience and system reliability

#### 3. API Rate Limiting and Caching
**Files**: API routes and middleware
**Issues**:
- In-memory rate limiting (doesn't scale)
- No API response caching
- Missing request validation middleware

**Recommended Implementation**:
```typescript
// Redis-based rate limiting
class RateLimiter {
  async checkLimit(key: string, limit: number, window: number): Promise<boolean> {
    const redis = await getRedisClient()
    const current = await redis.incr(key)

    if (current === 1) {
      await redis.expire(key, window)
    }

    return current <= limit
  }
}

// Response caching middleware
function withCache(ttl: number = 300) {
  return async (req: NextRequest, res: NextResponse) => {
    const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(req)
    const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey)

    if (cached) {
      return new Response(cached, {
        headers: { 'x-cache': 'hit' }
      })
    }

    // Process request and cache response
  }
}
```

**Effort**: 20 hours
**Impact**: 10x improvement in API response times for cached data

### ðŸŸ  Medium Priority (Address within 1 month)

#### 1. Workflow Engine Optimization
**Files**: Workflow execution and task processing
**Issues**:
- Task queue processing is basic
- No workflow state machine validation
- Missing error recovery mechanisms

**Effort**: 32 hours
**Recommendation**: Implement robust workflow engine with state machines

#### 2. Testing Infrastructure Gaps
**Files**: Test configuration and coverage
**Issues**:
- Integration tests not covering multi-tenant scenarios
- Performance tests missing
- Security tests not automated

**Current Test Coverage**: ~60%
**Target Test Coverage**: 85%
**Effort**: 40 hours

#### 3. Documentation and Development Experience
**Issues**:
- API documentation not auto-generated
- Development setup documentation scattered
- Missing architectural diagrams

**Effort**: 24 hours
**Impact**: Reduced onboarding time for new developers

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Address within 3 months)

#### 1. Code Organization and Modularity
**Issues**:
- Large API route handlers
- Business logic mixed with API logic
- Shared utilities could be better organized

**Effort**: 48 hours
**Impact**: Improved maintainability and testing

#### 2. Advanced Security Features
**Issues**:
- No anomaly detection for user behavior
- Missing advanced threat protection
- Limited security automation

**Effort**: 60 hours
**Impact**: Enhanced security posture for enterprise clients

## Scaling Recommendations for 10,000+ Users

### Immediate Scaling Bottlenecks

1. **Database Connection Pooling**
   ```typescript
   // Current: Default Prisma connection pool
   // Recommended: Optimized connection pool
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     // Add connection pool configuration
     connectionLimit = 100
     poolTimeout = 60
   }
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**
   ```yaml
   Implementation Plan:
   Phase 1: Redis for session storage and rate limiting
   Phase 2: Application-level caching for reference data
   Phase 3: CDN caching for static assets and API responses
   Phase 4: Database query result caching
   ```

3. **Asset Optimization**
   ```yaml
   Optimizations Needed:
   - Image resizing and WebP conversion
   - JavaScript bundle optimization
   - CSS critical path optimization
   - Font loading optimization
   ```

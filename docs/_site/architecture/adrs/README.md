# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the architectural decision records for AdvisorOS. Each ADR captures an important architectural decision made for the platform, including the context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the architectural challenge or decision that needs to be made]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision and how it addresses the challenge]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternative approaches that were considered and why they were rejected]

## Consequences
[Describe the positive and negative consequences of this decision]

## Metrics and Monitoring
[Define how the success of this decision will be measured]

## Future Considerations
[Identify areas where this decision might need to be revisited]
```

## Contributing to ADRs

1. **Identify Need**: Significant architectural decisions should be documented
2. **Draft ADR**: Create draft using the template above
3. **Review Process**: Technical review with architecture team
4. **Consensus**: Decision must be agreed upon by technical leadership
5. **Implementation**: ADR status updated once implemented
6. **Monitoring**: Regular review of ADR outcomes and metrics

## ADR Maintenance

ADRs are living documents that should be:
- **Reviewed Quarterly**: Ensure decisions are still relevant
- **Updated When Superseded**: Link to newer decisions that replace them
- **Measured**: Track success metrics defined in each ADR
- **Referenced**: Link from code and documentation to relevant ADRs

# ADR-004: Azure Infrastructure Choices and Scaling Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AdvisorOS requires a cloud infrastructure that can scale to support 10,000+ concurrent users across multiple organizations while maintaining security, compliance, and cost efficiency. The platform handles sensitive financial data requiring SOC2 compliance and high availability.

## Decision
We have implemented an Azure-based infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with a multi-environment, auto-scaling architecture:

### Core Infrastructure Components:

```

### Scaling Strategy:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   ```hcl
   # Auto-scaling configuration
   resource "azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting" "web_app" {
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
     target_resource_id  = azurerm_service_plan.main.id

     profile {
       name = "Default"
       capacity {
         default = 2
         minimum = 2
         maximum = 20
       }

       rule {
         metric_trigger {
           metric_name      = "CpuPercentage"
           operator         = "GreaterThan"
           threshold        = 75
           time_window      = "PT5M"
         }
         scale_action {
           direction = "Increase"
           type      = "ChangeCount"
           value     = "2"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Database Scaling**
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Automatic compute scaling (2-64 vCores)
   - **Storage Scaling**: Auto-grow storage (32GB to 16TB)
   - **Read Replicas**: Geographic distribution for read workloads
   - **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for connection optimization

3. **Storage Scaling**
   - **Blob Storage**: Virtually unlimited with hot/cool/archive tiers
   - **CDN Caching**: Global edge locations for static assets
   - **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli for reduced bandwidth

### Multi-Environment Strategy:

```yaml
# Environment Configuration
Development:
  - App Service: B1 Basic
  - Database: B_Gen5_1 (1 vCore)
  - Storage: LRS replication
  - Monitoring: Basic metrics

Staging:
  - App Service: S1 Standard
  - Database: GP_Gen5_2 (2 vCores)
  - Storage: GRS replication
  - Monitoring: Full Application Insights

Production:
  - App Service: P2V3 Premium (auto-scale 2-20)
  - Database: BC_Gen5_4 (4 vCores, HA enabled)
  - Storage: RA-GRS replication
  - Monitoring: Comprehensive + alerts
```

## Alternatives Considered

1. **AWS Infrastructure**: Similar capabilities but team expertise favors Azure
2. **Google Cloud Platform**: Strong AI/ML but less enterprise integration
3. **Multi-Cloud**: Adds complexity without significant benefits
4. **Kubernetes (AKS)**: Overkill for current application architecture
5. **Serverless (Azure Functions)**: Not suitable for monolithic Next.js app

## Infrastructure Decisions

### 1. App Service vs Azure Container Instances
**Chosen: App Service Plan**
- Built-in auto-scaling and load balancing
- Integrated deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments
- Native Next.js support with Node.js runtime
- Simplified certificate management

### 2. Azure Database for PostgreSQL vs Cosmos DB
**Chosen: PostgreSQL Flexible Server**
- Strong consistency required for financial data
- Complex relational queries for reporting
- Prisma ORM compatibility
- ACID compliance for transactions

### 3. Blob Storage vs Azure Files
**Chosen: Blob Storage with CDN**
- Better performance for document serving
- Cost-effective for large file storage
- Integration with Azure CDN
- Programmatic access for file processing

### 4. Application Insights vs Third-party Monitoring
**Chosen: Application Insights + Log Analytics**
- Native Azure integration
- Comprehensive performance monitoring
- Custom metrics and dashboards
- Cost-effective for Azure workloads

## Scaling Thresholds and Targets

### Performance Targets:
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile < 2 seconds
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Throughput**: 10,000 concurrent users
- **Database**: < 100ms average query time

### Scaling Triggers:
```yaml
Auto-scaling Rules:
  Scale Out:
    - CPU > 75% for 5 minutes
    - Memory > 80% for 5 minutes
    - HTTP Queue > 100 requests
  Scale In:
    - CPU < 25% for 15 minutes
    - Memory < 40% for 15 minutes
    - HTTP Queue < 10 requests

Database Scaling:
  Read Replicas: Query latency > 200ms
  Compute Scale: CPU > 80% for 10 minutes
  Storage Scale: Available space < 20%
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Current Cost Structure:
```
Monthly Azure Costs (Production):
├── App Service Plan P2V3: $150/month (baseline)
├── PostgreSQL Flexible Server: $280/month
├── Storage Account: $50/month
├── Application Insights: $30/month
├── CDN: $20/month
├── Key Vault: $5/month
└── Networking: $25/month
Total Baseline: ~$560/month
```

### Cost Optimization Techniques:
1. **Reserved Instances**: 1-year commitment for 30% savings
2. **Auto-shutdown**: Development environments shut down after hours
3. **Storage Tiering**: Move old documents to cool/archive storage
4. **Resource Tagging**: Track costs by environment and feature
5. **Monitoring**: Set up cost alerts and budget thresholds

## Security and Compliance

### Network Security:
- **VNet Integration**: Private networking for App Service
- **NSG Rules**: Network security groups for traffic filtering
- **Private Endpoints**: Database accessible only via private network
- **WAF Rules**: Web Application Firewall for protection

### Data Security:
- **Encryption at Rest**: All storage encrypted with customer-managed keys
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key Vault**: Centralized secret management
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for all resources

### Compliance Features:
- **Audit Logging**: All Azure resource activity logged
- **Backup Strategy**: 35-day retention with geo-redundancy
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region failover capabilities
- **Security Center**: Continuous security assessment

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics:
```yaml
Application Metrics:
  - Request/response times
  - Error rates and exceptions
  - User session analytics
  - Feature usage patterns

Infrastructure Metrics:
  - CPU/Memory utilization
  - Database performance
  - Storage consumption
  - Network throughput

Business Metrics:
  - Active organizations
  - Document processing volume
  - API usage patterns
  - Cost per tenant
```

### Alerting Strategy:
- **Critical**: 99.9% availability, security incidents
- **Warning**: Performance degradation, capacity thresholds
- **Info**: Deployment notifications, cost anomalies

## Future Scaling Considerations

### 10,000+ User Scale:
1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Active-active across US East/West
2. **Database Sharding**: Partition by organization hash
3. **Microservices Migration**: Break monolith into domain services
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async processing with Service Bus
5. **Caching Layer**: Redis Cache for session and application data

### 100,000+ User Scale:
1. **Global Distribution**: Azure regions worldwide
2. **Data Partitioning**: Geographic data residency
3. **Event Sourcing**: Append-only event store for audit
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write data models
5. **Edge Computing**: Process documents at edge locations

# SOC 2 Type II Compliance Overview

## Introduction

AdvisorOS has achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. This document provides an overview of our SOC 2 compliance program and the controls we have implemented to protect customer data and systems.

## What is SOC 2?

### SOC 2 Definition

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is an auditing procedure that ensures service companies securely manage data to protect client and organization interests. It is based on the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

### Type I vs Type II

- **SOC 2 Type I**: Evaluates the design of security controls at a specific point in time
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Evaluates the operational effectiveness of security controls over a period of time (typically 6-12 months)

AdvisorOS maintains SOC 2 Type II compliance, providing assurance that our controls are not only well-designed but also operating effectively over time.

Navigation Map . | Authentication &amp; Authorization | Core Request Model | Domain Endpoints | Event Streaming &amp; Webhooks | Quality Gates &amp; Monitoring | . Authentication &amp; Authorization . JWT Lifecycle — Provision tokens with the right guardrails 1. **Token Issuance** ```http POST /api/auth/login Content-Type: application/json { \"email\": \"integrations@advisoros.example\", \"password\": \"\", \"organizationId\": \"org-hero\" } ``` - Response bundles access and refresh tokens with 60-minute expiry. 2. **Refresh Flow** ```http POST /api/auth/refresh Content-Type: application/json { \"refreshToken\": \"\" } ``` - Store refresh tokens in KMS-backed vaults; never ship them in client-side code. 3. **Step-Up (2FA) Verification** ```http POST /api/auth/2fa/verify Authorization: Bearer { \"code\": \"123456\" } ``` - Use for privileged operations (e.g., remapping payout accounts). &lt;/details&gt; Access Control Design — Align scopes with least privilege - Map roles to scopes documented in [FEATURES.md](/AdvisorOS/FEATURES.html#role-based-capabilities). - Apply organization headers to every request: ```http X-Organization-ID: X-Request-ID: ``` - Enforce rate limits per client key (default: 600 requests/minute burst, 10,000/day sustained). &lt;/details&gt; ### Core Request Model &gt; [!NOTE] &gt; Every endpoint honors JSON payloads, deterministic pagination, and verbose error envelopes so downstream automation can be resilient. ```http Content-Type: application/json Authorization: Bearer X-Organization-ID: X-Request-ID: ``` **Standard Response Envelope** ```json { \"success\": true, \"data\": {}, \"warnings\": [], \"meta\": { \"requestId\": \"uuid\", \"pagination\": { \"cursor\": \"opaque-token\", \"hasMore\": false } } } ``` - **Errors**: Delivered with HTTP status, machine-readable `code`, human-friendly `message`, and contextual `details` array. - **Pagination**: Use `meta.pagination.cursor`; send `?cursor=...` on subsequent calls. ### Domain Endpoints Client Management — Create, update, and archive client records - `GET /api/v1/clients` — Paginated client list with filtering on status, advisor, and lifecycle stage. - `POST /api/v1/clients` — Create clients; requires `client:write` scope and validated identity payload. - `PATCH /api/v1/clients/{clientId}` — Partial updates; optimistic locking with `If-Match` header. - **Validation**: Run schema checks using the JSON schemas in [`api-specs/clients.yaml`](api-specs/clients.yaml). Document Management — Orchestrate secure uploads and AI classification - `POST /api/v1/documents/upload-url` — Issue single-use signed URLs; integrates with Azure Blob SAS tokens. - `POST /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/classify` — Invokes Azure AI; returns classification confidence scores. - **Monitoring**: Correlate with the observability guidance in [operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](/AdvisorOS/operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.html#observability). Billing &amp; Revenue — Sync financial operations through Stripe - `POST /api/v1/billing/invoices` — Create invoices referencing AdvisorOS fee schedules. - `POST /api/v1/billing/webhooks/stripe` — Consume Stripe events; validate signatures via `Stripe-Signature` header. - **Settlement Checks**: Reference [FINANCIAL_ANALYTICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../FINANCIAL_ANALYTICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for reconciliation practices. Workflow Automation — Automate advisory tasks end-to-end - `POST /api/v1/workflows/{workflowId}/trigger` - `GET /api/v1/workflows/runs?status=active` - **Mermaid Snapshot** ```mermaid graph LR Start --&gt; Intake{Intake} Intake --&gt; Review[Advisor Review] Review --&gt; Compliance{Compliance Hold} Compliance --&gt; Complete[Client Delivery] ``` ### Event Streaming &amp; Webhooks &gt; [!WARNING] &gt; Subscribe thoughtfully—duplicate webhook processing is the #1 source of downstream reconciliation work. - Configure webhook destinations in the AdvisorOS console; signatures rotate every 90 days. - Event payloads follow the structure stored in [`api-specs/events.yaml`](api-specs/events.yaml). - Leverage idempotency keys in the `X-Event-ID` header to avoid duplicate processing. ### Quality Gates &amp; Monitoring - **Pre-Deployment Tests**: Run `node verify-all-integrations.js` to execute contract tests against critical endpoints. - **Runtime Telemetry**: Subscribe to the API latency and error budget dashboards in Grafana (see [operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](/AdvisorOS/operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.html#dashboards)). - **Alerting**: Configure PagerDuty routing using the templates in [ops/tooling-dashboard.ts](../ops/tooling-dashboard.ts). ## Future Enhancements | Theme | Description | Owner / ETA | --- | --- | --- | Optimization | Expand bulk endpoints with async job orchestration to support 10x record loads. | Platform Engineering / Q4 | Innovation | Introduce GraphQL façade for partner experiences needing flexible aggregations. | Product Innovation / Pilot in Q1 | Risk Mitigation | Deliver field-level encryption for sensitive client data at rest and in transit. | Security Engineering / In Discovery | &gt; [!CAUTION] &gt; Achieving the roadmap above requires dedicated performance testing capacity and alignment with external partners for contract updates. ## Cross-References - [FEATURES.md](/AdvisorOS/FEATURES.html) — Map API capabilities to the end-user experiences and entitlements they unlock. - [operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](/AdvisorOS/operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.html) — Coordinate release gates, monitoring hooks, and rollback strategy. - [INTEGRATION_GUIDES.md](/AdvisorOS/INTEGRATION_GUIDES.html) — Pair endpoint usage with connector-specific configuration. - [COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](../COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) — Validate compliance considerations tied to API traffic.

Step-by-Step Playbooks . Act I — Prepare — Set the stage for a reliable release 1. **Branch Hygiene** — Ensure feature branches are rebased on `main` and pass quality checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`). 2. **Configuration Review** — Validate environment manifests in [`apps`](../apps) via `npm run format` (dry run) and peer review secrets. 3. **Dry Run** — Execute `terraform plan` from [`infrastructure/`](../infrastructure/) targeting the destination workspace. Act II — Deploy — Execute with precision 1. **Trigger Pipeline** — Tag the release; GitHub Actions workflow `deploy.yml` packages containers and applies Terraform. 2. **Database Migration** — Apply schema changes with `npm run db:migrate` (wraps the platform migration engine with transactional safety). 3. **Feature Flags** — Use the admin console to stage new features off by default; follow the toggles documented in [FEATURES.md](/AdvisorOS/FEATURES.html#feature-flags). Act III — Validate — Confirm the experience feels effortless 1. **Smoke Tests** — Run `npm run build` followed by targeted scenario validation using [`test-integrations.js`](../test-integrations.js). 2. **Observability Sweep** — Confirm healthy metrics and zero alerts via Grafana dashboards linked in [operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](/AdvisorOS/operations/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.html#dashboards). 3. **Stakeholder Playback** — Capture executive sign-off in the deployment record; note any follow-up actions in [POST_LAUNCH_SUPPORT_OPTIMIZATION.md](../POST_LAUNCH_SUPPORT_OPTIMIZATION.md).

Prisma Client Configuration . // lib/prisma.ts import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'; const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient | undefined; }; export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({ log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'], }); if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma; . 2. Type-Safe Query Builder . // lib/queryBuilder.ts export function buildClientQuery(params: ClientQueryParams) { const where: Prisma.ClientWhereInput = { organizationId: params.organizationId, }; if (params.status) { where.status = params.status; } if (params.search) { where.OR = [ { businessName: { contains: params.search, mode: 'insensitive' } }, { primaryContactEmail: { contains: params.search, mode: 'insensitive' } } ]; } return { where, include: { documents: { take: 5, orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' } }, quickbooksData: true }, orderBy: { [params.sortBy]: params.sortOrder } }; } . 3. Transaction Management . // services/clientService.ts export async function createClientWithDocuments( clientData: CreateClientInput, documents: DocumentInput[] ) { return prisma.$transaction(async (tx) =&gt; { const client = await tx.client.create({ data: clientData }); const documentPromises = documents.map(doc =&gt; tx.document.create({ data: { ...doc, clientId: client.id, organizationId: client.organizationId } }) ); await Promise.all(documentPromises); return client; }); } .

Consistent Response Format . // lib/apiResponse.ts export interface ApiResponse&lt;T = any&gt; { success: boolean; data?: T; error?: { code: string; message: string; details?: any; }; meta?: { timestamp: string; requestId: string; pagination?: PaginationMeta; }; } export function createApiResponse&lt;T&gt;( data: T, meta?: Partial&lt;ApiResponse['meta']&gt; ): ApiResponse&lt;T&gt; { return { success: true, data, meta: { timestamp: new Date().toISOString(), requestId: generateRequestId(), ...meta } }; } . 2. Error Handling Middleware . // middleware/errorHandler.ts export function withErrorHandler&lt;T extends any[], R&gt;( handler: (...args: T) =&gt; Promise&lt;R&gt; ) { return async (...args: T): Promise&lt;Response&gt; =&gt; { try { const result = await handler(...args); return Response.json(createApiResponse(result)); } catch (error) { console.error('API Error:', error); if (error instanceof ValidationError) { return Response.json( createErrorResponse('VALIDATION_ERROR', error.message, error.details), { status: 400 } ); } if (error instanceof AuthorizationError) { return Response.json( createErrorResponse('UNAUTHORIZED', 'Access denied'), { status: 403 } ); } return Response.json( createErrorResponse('INTERNAL_ERROR', 'An unexpected error occurred'), { status: 500 } ); } }; } . 3.

Input Validation . // schemas/clientSchemas.ts import { z } from 'zod'; export const createClientSchema = z.object({ businessName: z.string().min(1).max(255), legalName: z.string().optional(), taxId: z.string().regex(/^\\d{2}-\\d{7}$/).optional(), primaryContactEmail: z.string().email(), businessType: z.enum(['LLC', 'Corporation', 'Partnership', 'Sole_Proprietorship']), industry: z.string().optional(), website: z.string().url().optional(), customFields: z.record(z.any()).optional() }); export const updateClientSchema = createClientSchema.partial(); // Usage in API route export const POST = withAuth(withErrorHandler(async (request, context) =&gt; { const body = await request.json(); const validatedData = createClientSchema.parse(body); const client = await clientService.create(validatedData, context.organizationId); return client; })); . Real-Time Features .

Compound Component Pattern: . // components/ui/Modal.tsx interface ModalProps { children: React.ReactNode; isOpen: boolean; onClose: () =&gt; void; } export function Modal({ children, isOpen, onClose }: ModalProps) { if (!isOpen) return null; return ( &lt;div className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}&gt; &lt;div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={e =&gt; e.stopPropagation()}&gt; {children} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } Modal.Header = function ModalHeader({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) { return &lt;div className=\"modal-header\"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;; }; Modal.Body = function ModalBody({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) { return &lt;div className=\"modal-body\"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;; }; Modal.Footer = function ModalFooter({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) { return &lt;div className=\"modal-footer\"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;; }; // Usage &lt;Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}&gt; &lt;Modal.Header&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Edit Client&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/Modal.Header&gt; &lt;Modal.Body&gt; &lt;ClientForm client={client} /&gt; &lt;/Modal.Body&gt; &lt;Modal.Footer&gt; &lt;Button onClick={onSave}&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt; &lt;Button onClick={onClose}&gt;Cancel&lt;/Button&gt; &lt;/Modal.Footer&gt; &lt;/Modal&gt; . 3. State Management . Global State with Zustand: . // stores/useClientStore.ts interface ClientStore { clients: Client[]; selectedClient: Client | null; filters: ClientFilters; setClients: (clients: Client[]) =&gt; void; setSelectedClient: (client: Client | null) =&gt; void; updateFilters: (filters: Partial&lt;ClientFilters&gt;) =&gt; void; addClient: (client: Client) =&gt; void; updateClient: (id: string, updates: Partial&lt;Client&gt;) =&gt; void; removeClient: (id: string) =&gt; void; } export const useClientStore = create&lt;ClientStore&gt;((set, get) =&gt; ({ clients: [], selectedClient: null, filters: {}, setClients: (clients) =&gt; set({ clients }), setSelectedClient: (selectedClient) =&gt; set({ selectedClient }), updateFilters: (newFilters) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({ filters: { ...state.filters, ...newFilters } })), addClient: (client) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({ clients: [...state.clients, client] })), updateClient: (id, updates) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({ clients: state.clients.map(client =&gt; client.id === id ? { ...client, ...updates } : client ) })), removeClient: (id) =&gt; set((state) =&gt; ({ clients: state.clients.filter(client =&gt; client.id !== id) })) })); . Server State with React Query: . // hooks/useClients.ts export function useClients(filters?: ClientFilters) { return useQuery({ queryKey: ['clients', filters], queryFn: () =&gt; clientApi.getClients(filters), staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes }); } export function useCreateClient() { const queryClient = useQueryClient(); return useMutation({ mutationFn: clientApi.createClient, onSuccess: (newClient) =&gt; { // Update cache queryClient.setQueryData(['clients'], (oldData: Client[]) =&gt; oldData ? [...oldData, newClient] : [newClient] ); // Invalidate related queries queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['clients'] }); }, }); } . 4. Form Management . React Hook Form Integration: . // components/forms/ClientForm.tsx import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'; import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'; interface ClientFormProps { client?: Client; onSubmit: (data: ClientFormData) =&gt; void; onCancel: () =&gt; void; } export function ClientForm({ client, onSubmit, onCancel }: ClientFormProps) { const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors, isSubmitting }, watch, setValue } = useForm&lt;ClientFormData&gt;({ resolver: zodResolver(clientFormSchema), defaultValues: client || {}, }); return ( &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className=\"space-y-4\"&gt; &lt;Input label=\"Business Name\" {...register('businessName')} error={errors.businessName?.message} /&gt; &lt;Input label=\"Primary Contact Email\" type=\"email\" {...register('primaryContactEmail')} error={errors.primaryContactEmail?.message} /&gt; &lt;Select label=\"Business Type\" {...register('businessType')} error={errors.businessType?.message} &gt; &lt;option value=\"\"&gt;Select business type&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value=\"LLC\"&gt;LLC&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value=\"Corporation\"&gt;Corporation&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value=\"Partnership\"&gt;Partnership&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/Select&gt; &lt;div className=\"flex justify-end space-x-2\"&gt; &lt;Button type=\"button\" variant=\"secondary\" onClick={onCancel}&gt; Cancel &lt;/Button&gt; &lt;Button type=\"submit\" disabled={isSubmitting}&gt; {isSubmitting ?

Pagination Always use pagination for list endpoints to avoid performance issues: ```typescript // Good const clients = await client.client.list.query({ pagination: { page: 1, limit: 25 } }) // Avoid - could return thousands of records const allClients = await client.client.list.query() ``` ### 2. Filtering Use specific filters to reduce data transfer and improve performance: ```typescript // Good - specific filters const activeCorps = await client.client.list.query({ filters: { status: ['active'], businessType: ['corporation'] } }) // Less efficient - broad search const searched = await client.client.search.query({ query: 'corp' }) ``` ### 3. Error Handling Always handle specific error types: ```typescript try { const client = await client.client.byId.query({ id: clientId }) } catch (error) { if (error.data?.code === 'NOT_FOUND') { // Handle missing client } else if (error.data?.code === 'UNAUTHORIZED') { // Handle auth error } else { // Handle unexpected errors } } ``` ### 4. Bulk Operations Use bulk operations for multiple similar actions: ```typescript // Good - single bulk operation await client.client.bulkOperation.mutate({ action: 'update', clientIds: clientIds, data: { riskLevel: 'medium' } }) // Inefficient - multiple individual operations for (const clientId of clientIds) { await client.client.update.mutate({ id: clientId, riskLevel: 'medium' }) } ``` ### 5. Data Validation Use the validation endpoints before creating/updating: ```typescript // Validate before creating const nameCheck = await client.client.validateBusinessName.query({ businessName: 'New Company Inc' }) if (!nameCheck.isAvailable) { throw new Error('Business name already exists') } const newClient = await client.client.create.mutate({ businessName: 'New Company Inc', // ... other fields }) ``` ",

    "content": "# ADR-003: Next.js App Router Structure and API Design ## Status Accepted ## Context AdvisorOS requires a modern, scalable frontend architecture that supports both public marketing pages and complex tenant-specific dashboard applications. The application must handle role-based access control, real-time features, and seamless integration with external services. ## Decision We have implemented Next.js 14 with App Router using a hybrid monorepo structure that combines public marketing pages and tenant dashboard within a single application: ### Application Architecture: ``` apps/web/src/app/ ├── (public)/ # Public marketing pages │ ├── page.tsx # Landing page │ ├── pricing/ # Pricing page │ ├── about/ # About page │ └── contact/ # Contact forms ├── auth/ # Authentication flows │ ├── signin/ # Multi-tenant signin │ ├── register/ # Organization signup │ └── invite/ # User invitation flow ├── dashboard/ # Tenant dashboard (authenticated) │ ├── clients/ # Client management │ ├── documents/ # Document management │ ├── workflows/ # Process automation │ └── reports/ # Financial reporting ├── portal/ # Client portal (separate subdomain) │ ├── documents/ # Client document access │ └── tax-returns/ # Tax return status └── api/ # API routes ├── auth/ # Authentication endpoints ├── clients/ # Client CRUD operations ├── documents/ # Document processing ├── workflows/ # Workflow automation ├── reports/ # Report generation ├── quickbooks/ # QuickBooks integration ├── stripe/ # Billing integration └── trpc/ # Type-safe API layer ``` ### Key Architectural Decisions: 1. **Route Organization Strategy** - **Route Groups**: `(public)` for marketing, `(auth)` for authentication flows - **Dynamic Routes**: `[organizationId]` for tenant-specific pages - **Parallel Routes**: Dashboard layouts with multiple data streams - **Intercepting Routes**: Modal overlays for document preview 2. **API Layer Architecture** - **tRPC Integration**: Type-safe client-server communication - **REST API Routes**: Next.js API routes for external integrations - **Webhook Handlers**: Dedicated routes for third-party webhooks - **File Upload**: Specialized routes for document processing 3. **State Management Pattern** - **React Query (TanStack)**: Server state management and caching -

**JWT Tokens**: Stateless session management - **Middleware**: Route-level authorization - **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system ### API Design Patterns: ```typescript // tRPC Router Structure export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({ auth: authRouter, // Authentication procedures client: clientRouter, // Client management document: documentRouter, // Document processing workflow: workflowRouter, // Process automation report: reportRouter, // Financial reporting integration: integrationRouter, // External services }) // Multi-tenant API pattern export async function GET(request: NextRequest) { const organizationId = request.headers.get('x-organization-id') const userRole = request.headers.get('x-user-role') // Validate organization context if (!organizationId) { return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing organization context' }, { status: 400 }) } // Apply tenant filtering const clients = await prisma.client.findMany({ where: { organizationId }, // Additional filtering based on user role }) return NextResponse.json(clients) } ``` ## Alternatives Considered 1. **Separate Applications**: Would increase deployment complexity and reduce code sharing 2. **Pages Router**: Less flexible routing and SSR capabilities than App Router 3. **Pure SPA**: Would lose SEO benefits and increase client-side complexity 4. **GraphQL**: More complex than needed for current requirements 5. **Micro-frontends**: Overkill for current scale, considered for future ## Consequences ### Positive: - **Performance**: App Router provides advanced caching and SSR capabilities - **Developer Experience**: File-based routing with TypeScript integration - **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with tRPC and Prisma - **SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering for marketing pages - **Code Sharing**: Shared components between public and dashboard areas - **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking and code splitting out of the box ### Negative: - **Complexity**: App Router learning curve for team members - **Bundle Size**: Large application bundle for complex dashboard - **Cold Start**: Server-side rendering can increase initial load time - **State Synchronization**: Complex state management between client/server ### Implementation Guidelines: 1. **Component Architecture** ```typescript // Server Components by default export default async function ClientsPage() { const clients = await getClients() // Direct database query return } // Client Components for interactivity 'use client' export function ClientForm() { const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false) // Client-side logic } ``` 2. **Error Handling Strategy** - **Error Boundaries**: Catch client-side errors - **Error Pages**: Custom error pages for different scenarios - **Global Error Handler**: Centralized error logging and reporting 3. **Performance Optimizations** - **Streaming**: Progressive page loading with Suspense - **Caching**: Aggressive caching for static and dynamic content - **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for responsive images - **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring and optimization ## Scaling Considerations ### Current Optimizations: - **Route Handlers**: Efficient API routes with middleware - **Component Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for heavy components - **Asset Optimization**: Image optimization and compression - **CDN Integration**: Static asset delivery via CDN ### Future Enhancements: 1. **Edge Runtime**: Move API routes to edge for global performance 2. **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Cache dynamic content with revalidation 3. **Micro-frontend Architecture**: Federated modules for large teams 4. **Progressive Web App**: Offline capabilities and native-like experience ## Development Workflow ### Local Development: ```bash # Turborepo orchestration npm run dev # Start all applications npm run build # Build for production npm run test # Run test suites npm run lint # Code quality checks ``` ### API Testing Strategy: - **Unit Tests**: Individual API route testing - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing - **Performance Tests**: Load testing for critical endpoints - **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization validation ## Monitoring and Analytics - Page load performance and Core Web Vitals - API response times and error rates - User interaction tracking and conversion funnels - Bundle size monitoring and optimization alerts - Security audit for authentication flows ",

The API follows RESTful principles while providing the benefits of end-to-end type safety. ## Table of Contents ### API Architecture - [tRPC Introduction](./trpc/introduction.md) - [Authentication & Authorization](./authentication.md) - [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) - [Rate Limiting](./rate-limiting.md) - [Pagination](./pagination.md) ### API Routes - [Client Management API](/AdvisorOS/api/routes/client.html) - [Enhanced API Routes](./routes/enhanced-api.md) - [Financial Analytics API](./routes/financial-analytics.md) - [Document Management API](./routes/documents.md) - [User Management API](./routes/users.md) - [Organization API](./routes/organization.md) ### Integration Guides - [QuickBooks Integration](./integrations/quickbooks.md) - [Azure Services](./integrations/azure.md) - [Webhooks](./integrations/webhooks.md) ### SDK Documentation - [TypeScript SDK](./sdks/typescript.md) - [JavaScript SDK](./sdks/javascript.md) - [REST API Reference](./rest/openapi.yaml) ### Development Tools - [Postman Collection](./tools/postman.md) - [API Testing](./testing/api-testing.md) - [Monitoring & Analytics](./monitoring.md) ## Quick Start ### 1. Authentication All API requests require authentication. AdvisorOS supports multiple authentication methods: ```typescript // Using the TypeScript client import { createTRPCMsw } from '@trpc/msw' import type { AppRouter } from '@/server/api/root' const client = createTRPCClient({ url: 'https://api.advisoros.com/api/trpc', headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, }, }) ``` ### 2. Making API Calls #### Query Example (Read Operations) ```typescript // Get list of clients const clients = await client.client.list.query({ filters: { status: ['active'], search: 'Acme Corp' }, pagination: { page: 1, limit: 20 } }) ``` #### Mutation Example (Write Operations) ```typescript // Create a new client const newClient = await client.client.create.mutate({ businessName: 'Acme Corporation', businessType: 'corporation', primaryContactEmail: 'contact@acme.com', primaryContactName: 'John Doe', address: { street: '123 Business St', city: 'Business City', state: 'CA', zipCode: '90210' } }) ``` ### 3. Error Handling ```typescript try { const client = await client.client.byId.query({ id: 'invalid-id' }) } catch (error) { if (error.data?.code === 'NOT_FOUND') { console.log('Client not found') } else if (error.data?.code === 'UNAUTHORIZED') { console.log('Authentication required') } else { console.log('Unexpected error:', error.message) } } ``` ## API Base URLs ### Production ``` https://api.advisoros.com/api/trpc ``` ### Staging ``` https://staging-api.advisoros.com/api/trpc ``` ### Development ``` http://localhost:3000/api/trpc ``` ## Authentication ### Bearer Token Authentication Include your API token in the Authorization header: ```http Authorization: Bearer your-api-token-here ``` ### Session-Based Authentication For web applications, authentication is handled via secure HTTP-only cookies: ```http Cookie: __Secure-next-auth.session-token=your-session-token ``` ### Organization Context All API requests are scoped to your organization. The organization context is automatically determined from your authentication token. ## Response Format ### Success Response ```typescript { result: { data: { // Your requested data } } } ``` ### Error Response ```typescript { error: { message: \"Error description\", code: \"ERROR_CODE\", data: { code: \"TRPC_ERROR_CODE\", httpStatus: 400, path: \"client.create\", stack: \"...\" // Only in development } } } ``` ## Rate Limiting API requests are subject to rate limiting: - **Standard Plan**: 1,000 requests per hour - **Professional Plan**: 5,000 requests per hour - **Enterprise Plan**: 25,000 requests per hour Rate limit headers are included in all responses: ```http X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000 X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999 X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200 ``` ## Pagination Most list endpoints support pagination: ```typescript { pagination: { page: 1, // Page number (1-based) limit: 20, // Items per page (max 100) offset: 0 // Alternative to page-based pagination } } ``` Response includes pagination metadata: ```typescript { data: [...], pagination: { total: 150, pages: 8, page: 1, limit: 20, hasNext: true, hasPrev: false } } ``` ## Filtering and Sorting ### Filtering ```typescript { filters: { search: \"search term\", status: [\"active\", \"pending\"], createdAfter: new Date(\"2024-01-01\"), createdBefore: new Date(\"2024-12-31\") } } ``` ### Sorting ```typescript { sort: { field: \"createdAt\", direction: \"desc\" } } ``` ## Data Types and Schemas ### Common Types #### Client ```typescript interface Client { id: string businessName: string legalName?: string businessType: 'individual' | 'partnership' | 'corporation' | 'llc' | 'trust' status: 'prospect' | 'active' | 'inactive' | 'archived' primaryContactName: string primaryContactEmail: string primaryContactPhone?: string address?: Address taxId?: string quickbooksId?: string annualRevenue?: number riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' industry?: string createdAt: Date updatedAt: Date } ``` #### Address ```typescript interface Address { street: string street2?: string city: string state: string zipCode: string country?: string } ``` #### Pagination ```typescript interface PaginationInput { page?: number limit?: number offset?: number } interface PaginationOutput { total: number pages: number page: number limit: number hasNext: boolean hasPrev: boolean } ``` ## Webhooks AdvisorOS supports webhooks for real-time notifications: ### Supported Events - `client.created` - `client.updated` - `client.deleted` - `document.uploaded` - `quickbooks.sync.completed` ### Webhook Configuration ```typescript // Register a webhook endpoint await client.webhooks.create.mutate({ url: 'https://your-app.com/webhooks/advisoros', events: ['client.created', 'client.updated'], secret: 'your-webhook-secret' }) ``` ## Security ### SSL/TLS All API communications must use HTTPS. HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS. ### Data Encryption - All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 - All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3 - PII and sensitive data use additional encryption layers ### Audit Logging All API requests are logged for security and compliance purposes. Logs include: - Request timestamp - User/organization context - Endpoint accessed - Request parameters (sanitized) - Response status ## SDK Installation ### TypeScript/JavaScript ```bash npm install @advisoros/sdk ``` ```typescript import { AdvisorOSClient } from '@advisoros/sdk' const client = new AdvisorOSClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key', environment: 'production' // or 'staging', 'development' }) ``` ## Code Examples ### Client Management #### List Clients with Filters ```typescript const clients = await client.client.list.query({ filters: { status: ['active'], businessType: ['corporation', 'llc'], hasQuickBooks: true, annualRevenueMin: 100000 }, sort: { field: 'businessName', direction: 'asc' }, pagination: { page: 1, limit: 25 } }) ``` #### Create Client ```typescript const newClient = await client.client.create.mutate({ businessName: 'Tech Startup Inc', businessType: 'corporation', primaryContactName: 'Jane Smith', primaryContactEmail: 'jane@techstartup.com', primaryContactPhone: '+1-555-0123', address: { street: '456 Innovation Blvd', city: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA', zipCode: '94107' }, industry: 'technology', annualRevenue: 500000 }) ``` #### Update Client ```typescript const updatedClient = await client.client.update.mutate({ id: 'client-id', businessName: 'Updated Business Name', annualRevenue: 750000, riskLevel: 'medium' }) ``` #### Search Clients ```typescript const searchResults = await client.client.search.query({ query: 'Acme', limit: 10 }) ``` ### Document Management #### Upload Document ```typescript const document = await client.documents.upload.mutate({ clientId: 'client-id', file: fileBlob, category: 'tax_returns', metadata: { taxYear: 2024, documentType: 'form_1040' } }) ``` #### Get Client Documents ```typescript const documents = await client.client.getDocuments.query({ clientId: 'client-id', category: 'financial_statements', pagination: { page: 1, limit: 20 } }) ``` ## Support and Resources ### API Support - **Documentation**: [docs.advisoros.com/api](https://docs.advisoros.com/api) - **Status Page**: [status.advisoros.com](https://status.advisoros.com) - **Support Email**: api-support@advisoros.com - **Developer Forum**: [developers.advisoros.com](https://developers.advisoros.com) ### Rate Limit Increases Contact support for rate limit increases beyond standard plans. ### Enterprise Features Enterprise customers have access to: - Dedicated API endpoints - Custom rate limits - Priority support - Advanced analytics - Custom integrations For enterprise API access, contact enterprise@advisoros.com.

Multi-Tenancy AdvisorOS is built as a multi-tenant application where each CPA firm is an organization: ```typescript // Every database entity includes organizationId interface BaseEntity { id: string organizationId: string createdAt: Date updatedAt: Date } // All API procedures are organization-scoped export const clientRouter = createTRPCRouter({ list: organizationProcedure // Automatically filters by organizationId .input(clientListSchema) .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => { // ctx.organizationId is automatically available return await getClients(ctx.organizationId, input) }) }) ``` ### 2. Type Safety End-to-end type safety from database to UI: ```typescript // Database schema (Prisma) model Client { id String @id @default(cuid()) organizationId String businessName String primaryContactEmail String status ClientStatus createdAt DateTime @default(now()) updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt } // API types (Zod schemas) export const createClientSchema = z.object({ businessName: z.string().min(1), primaryContactEmail: z.string().email(), status: z.enum(['prospect', 'active', 'inactive']) }) // Frontend usage (fully typed) const createClient = api.client.create.useMutation() const handleSubmit = (data: CreateClientInput) => { createClient.mutate(data) // TypeScript knows the exact shape } ``` ### 3. Security Model Role-based access control (RBAC) with organization isolation: ```typescript // User roles within organizations enum Role { OWNER = 'owner', // Full access including billing ADMIN = 'admin', // Administrative access CPA = 'cpa', // Client and document management STAFF = 'staff' // Limited access to assigned clients } // Procedure-level authorization export const adminProcedure = organizationProcedure .use(({ ctx, next }) => { if (!['owner', 'admin'].includes(ctx.user.role)) { throw new TRPCError({ code: 'FORBIDDEN' }) } return next() }) ``` ## Development Patterns ### 1. API Development Pattern ```typescript // 1. Define Zod schema for validation export const createClientSchema = z.object({ businessName: z.string().min(1, 'Business name is required'), primaryContactEmail: z.string().email('Valid email required'), businessType: z.enum(['individual', 'corporation', 'llc', 'partnership']) }) // 2. Create service layer export class ClientService { static async createClient( data: CreateClientInput, organizationId: string, userId: string ): Promise { // Business logic here return await prisma.client.create({ data: { ...data, organizationId, createdBy: userId } }) } } // 3. Create tRPC procedure export const clientRouter = createTRPCRouter({ create: organizationProcedure .input(createClientSchema) .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { return await ClientService.createClient( input, ctx.organizationId, ctx.userId ) }) }) // 4. Use in frontend const createClient = api.client.create.useMutation({ onSuccess: () => { toast.success('Client created successfully') utils.client.list.invalidate() } }) ``` ### 2. Component Development Pattern ```typescript // 1. Define component props with TypeScript interface ClientFormProps { client?: Client onSubmit: (data: CreateClientInput) => void isLoading?: boolean } // 2. Create reusable component export function ClientForm({ client, onSubmit, isLoading }: ClientFormProps) { const form = useForm({ resolver: zodResolver(createClientSchema), defaultValues: client }) return ( ( Business Name )} /> {isLoading ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Client'} ) } // 3. Use in page component export default function CreateClientPage() { const createClient = api.client.create.useMutation() return ( createClient.mutate(data)} isLoading={createClient.isLoading} /> ) } ``` ### 3. Error Handling Pattern ```typescript // Server-side error handling export const clientRouter = createTRPCRouter({ create: organizationProcedure .input(createClientSchema) .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { try { return await ClientService.createClient(input, ctx.organizationId, ctx.userId) } catch (error) { if (error instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError) { if (error.code === 'P2002') { throw new TRPCError({ code: 'CONFLICT', message: 'Client with this email already exists' }) } } throw new TRPCError({ code: 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR', message: 'Failed to create client' }) } }) }) // Client-side error handling const createClient = api.client.create.useMutation({ onError: (error) => { if (error.data?.code === 'CONFLICT') { toast.error('A client with this email already exists') } else { toast.error('Failed to create client. Please try again.') } } }) ``` ## Development Tools ### 1. VS Code Extensions Our recommended VS Code extension pack includes: - **TypeScript Hero**: Auto-import and organize imports - **Prisma**: Database schema syntax highlighting - **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: CSS class suggestions - **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets**: React snippets - **GitLens**: Enhanced Git integration - **Thunder Client**: API testing within VS Code ### 2. Development Scripts ```json { \"scripts\": { \"dev\": \"next dev\", \"build\": \"next build\", \"start\": \"next start\", \"lint\": \"next lint\", \"lint:fix\": \"next lint --fix\", \"type-check\": \"tsc --noEmit\", \"test\": \"jest\", \"test:watch\": \"jest --watch\", \"test:coverage\": \"jest --coverage\", \"test:e2e\": \"playwright test\", \"db:generate\": \"prisma generate\", \"db:push\": \"prisma db push\", \"db:migrate\": \"prisma migrate dev\", \"db:studio\": \"prisma studio\", \"db:seed\": \"tsx prisma/seed.ts\" } } ``` ### 3. Code Quality Tools #### ESLint Configuration ```javascript // .eslintrc.js module.exports = { extends: [ 'next/core-web-vitals', '@typescript-eslint/recommended', 'prettier' ], rules: { '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': 'error', '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn', 'prefer-const': 'error' } } ``` #### Prettier Configuration ```json { \"semi\": false, \"singleQuote\": true, \"tabWidth\": 2, \"trailingComma\": \"es5\", \"printWidth\": 80 } ``` ## Testing Strategy ### 1. Unit Tests ```typescript // Test API procedures import { createTRPCMsw } from '@trpc/msw' import { appRouter } from '@/server/api/root' describe('Client API', () => { it('should create client with valid data', async () => { const caller = appRouter.createCaller({ organizationId: 'org-123', userId: 'user-123', prisma: mockPrisma }) const result = await caller.client.create({ businessName: 'Test Corp', primaryContactEmail: 'test@example.com', businessType: 'corporation' }) expect(result.businessName).toBe('Test Corp') }) }) ``` ### 2. Integration Tests ```typescript // Test database operations import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client' import { ClientService } from '@/lib/services/client-service' describe('ClientService Integration', () => { let prisma: PrismaClient beforeAll(async () => { prisma = new PrismaClient() await prisma.$connect() }) it('should create and retrieve client', async () => { const client = await ClientService.createClient({ businessName: 'Integration Test Corp', primaryContactEmail: 'integration@test.com', businessType: 'corporation' }, 'org-123', 'user-123') expect(client.id).toBeDefined() const retrieved = await ClientService.getClientById( client.id, 'org-123' ) expect(retrieved?.businessName).toBe('Integration Test Corp') }) }) ``` ### 3. E2E Tests ```typescript // Test complete user journeys import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test' test('client management workflow', async ({ page }) => { // Login await page.goto('/login') await page.fill('[data-testid=email]', 'test@example.com') await page.fill('[data-testid=password]', 'password') await page.click('[data-testid=login-button]') // Navigate to clients await page.click('[data-testid=clients-nav]') await expect(page).toHaveURL('/clients') // Create new client await page.click('[data-testid=add-client-button]') await page.fill('[data-testid=business-name]', 'E2E Test Corp') await page.fill('[data-testid=email]', 'e2e@test.com') await page.click('[data-testid=save-button]') // Verify client was created await expect(page.locator('text=E2E Test Corp')).toBeVisible() }) ``` ## Performance Considerations ### 1. Database Optimization ```typescript // Use appropriate indexes // In Prisma schema: model Client { id String @id @default(cuid()) organizationId String businessName String primaryContactEmail String @unique status ClientStatus @@index([organizationId, status]) @@index([organizationId, businessName]) } // Optimize queries with proper includes const clients = await prisma.client.findMany({ where: { organizationId }, include: { documents: { select: { id: true, name: true } // Only select needed fields } }, take: 20 // Pagination }) ``` ### 2. Frontend Optimization ```typescript // Use React.memo for expensive components export const ClientCard = React.memo(({ client }: { client: Client }) => { return ( {client.businessName} . {client.primaryContactEmail} . ) }) // Lazy load heavy components const DocumentViewer = lazy(() => import('@/components/DocumentViewer')) // Use useMemo for expensive computations const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => { return clients.reduce((acc, client) => acc + client.annualRevenue, 0) }, [clients]) ``` ### 3. API Optimization ```typescript // Implement proper caching export const clientRouter = createTRPCRouter({ list: organizationProcedure .input(clientListSchema) .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => { // Cache key based on organization and filters const cacheKey = `clients:${ctx.organizationId}:${JSON.stringify(input)}` return await redis.cache(cacheKey, async () => { return await ClientService.getClients(ctx.organizationId, input) }, { ttl: 300 }) // 5 minute cache }) }) ``` ## Security Best Practices ### 1. Input Validation ```typescript // Always validate inputs with Zod export const createClientSchema = z.object({ businessName: z.string() .min(1, 'Business name required') .max(255, 'Business name too long') .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\\s\\-&.,']+$/, 'Invalid characters'), primaryContactEmail: z.string().email('Valid email required'), taxId: z.string() .optional() .refine(val => !val || /^\\d{2}-\\d{7}$/.test(val), 'Invalid tax ID format') }) ``` ### 2. Authorization Checks ```typescript // Check permissions at every level export const deleteClientProcedure = organizationProcedure .input(z.object({ id: z.string().cuid() })) .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { // Verify client belongs to organization const client = await prisma.client.findFirst({ where: { id: input.id, organizationId: ctx.organizationId } }) if (!client) { throw new TRPCError({ code: 'NOT_FOUND' }) } // Check user has permission to delete if (ctx.user.role === 'staff') { throw new TRPCError({ code: 'FORBIDDEN' }) } return await ClientService.deleteClient(input.id, ctx.organizationId, ctx.userId) }) ``` ### 3. Data Sanitization ```typescript // Sanitize data before storage import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify' export function sanitizeClientData(data: CreateClientInput): CreateClientInput { return { ...data, businessName: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.businessName.trim()), primaryContactEmail: data.primaryContactEmail.toLowerCase().trim(), notes: data.notes ? DOMPurify.sanitize(data.notes) : undefined } } ``` ## Deployment Process ### 1. CI/CD Pipeline ```yaml # .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml name: CI/CD Pipeline on: push: branches: [main, develop] pull_request: branches: [main] jobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: '18' - run: npm ci - run: npm run lint - run: npm run type-check - run: npm run test - run: npm run test:e2e deploy: needs: test runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - run: npm ci - run: npm run build - name: Deploy to Azure uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1 with: azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }} ``` ### 2. Environment Management ```typescript // config/environment.ts export const env = { NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV as 'development' | 'production' | 'test', DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL!, NEXTAUTH_SECRET: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET!, AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING: process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING!, // Validate environment variables get isProduction() { return this.NODE_ENV === 'production' }, validate() { const required = ['DATABASE_URL', 'NEXTAUTH_SECRET'] for (const key of required) { if (!process.env[key]) { throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${key}`) } } } } // Validate on startup env.validate() ``` ## Monitoring and Debugging ### 1. Logging Strategy ```typescript // lib/logger.ts import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston' export const logger = createLogger({ level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info', format: format.combine( format.timestamp(), format.errors({ stack: true }), format.json() ), transports: [ new transports.Console(), new transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }), new transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) ] }) // Usage in API procedures export const clientRouter = createTRPCRouter({ create: organizationProcedure .input(createClientSchema) .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { logger.info('Creating client', { organizationId: ctx.organizationId, userId: ctx.userId, businessName: input.businessName }) try { const client = await ClientService.createClient(input, ctx.organizationId, ctx.userId) logger.info('Client created successfully', { clientId: client.id }) return client } catch (error) { logger.error('Failed to create client', { error, input }) throw error } }) }) ``` ### 2. Error Tracking ```typescript // lib/error-tracking.ts import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs' Sentry.init({ dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN, environment: process.env.NODE_ENV, tracesSampleRate: 1.0 }) // Custom error boundary export function withErrorBoundary>( Component: T ): T { return Sentry.withErrorBoundary(Component, { fallback: ({ error, resetError }) => ( ",

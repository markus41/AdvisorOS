# AdvisorOS Technical Doc Template

> [!TIP]
> Start every AdvisorOS technical narrative by anchoring the business impact before you unpack the build. This template blends executive-ready storytelling with the deep implementation detail delivery teams need.

## Overview

| Field | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Clarify the capability, the decisions it informs, and why this documentation matters now. |
| **Audience** | Name the primary roles, along with any prerequisite tooling or expertise. |
| **Context** | Summarize the problem space and the scenarios the asset covers using confident, plain language. |

> [!NOTE]
> Add a short "Why it matters" paragraph beneath the table that echoes the Advisory-first tone our partners expect.

## Business Value & ROI

| Outcome | Narrative | Leading Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue / Growth | Describe how the solution expands advisory services or wallet share. | e.g., New subscription uplift %, new segments launched |
| Efficiency | Quantify cycle-time reductions, automation savings, or utilization wins. | e.g., Hours saved / month, automation coverage % |
| Risk & Trust | Show how governance, compliance, or audit posture improves. | e.g., Reduction in exception handling, audit findings |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Close with a bullet list translating the table into finance-ready sound bites (2–3 bullets max).

# AdvisorOS Cost Optimization Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive cost optimization strategy for the AdvisorOS production environment, designed to handle tax season peak loads while maintaining cost efficiency during off-peak periods. The strategy focuses on right-sizing resources, implementing intelligent scaling, and leveraging Azure's cost management tools.

## Cost Optimization Pillars

### 1. Right-Sizing Resources

#### Current Architecture Cost Breakdown (Estimated Monthly)

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost (USD) | Tax Season Cost (USD) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| App Service Plan | P2v3 (3 instances) | $438 | $1,460 (10 instances) |
| PostgreSQL Flexible Server | GP_Gen5_4 | $350 | $350 |
| Azure Redis Cache | Premium P1 | $251 | $753 (P3) |
| Storage Account | Premium_ZRS (1TB) | $90 | $180 (2TB) |
| Application Gateway | Standard_v2 | $22 | $22 |
| Azure Front Door | Standard | $35 | $70 |
| Log Analytics | 50GB/month | $115 | $230 (100GB) |
| Application Insights | 10GB/month | $25 | $50 (20GB) |
| Key Vault | Standard | $3 | $3 |
| **Total** | | **$1,329** | **$3,118** |

#### Optimization Recommendations

##### Off-Peak Optimization (May - December)
- **App Service Plan**: Scale down to P1v3 (2 instances) - Save $219/month
- **Redis Cache**: Use Standard C2 instead of Premium P1 - Save $126/month
- **Storage**: Move to Standard_LRS for non-critical data - Save $45/month
- **Total Monthly Savings**: $390 (29% reduction)

##### Tax Season Optimization (January - April)
- **Auto-scaling**: Implement predictive scaling based on historical data
- **Reserved Instances**: Purchase 1-year reserved instances for base capacity
- **Spot Instances**: Use Azure Spot VMs for batch processing workloads

### 2. Intelligent Scaling Strategy

#### Time-Based Scaling Schedule

```json
{
  "scaling_schedule": {
    "off_season": {
      "period": "May 1 - December 31",
      "app_service": {
        "min_instances": 2,
        "max_instances": 5,
        "target_cpu": 70
      },
      "redis": {
        "sku": "Standard",
        "capacity": 1
      }
    },
    "pre_season": {
      "period": "January 1 - January 31",
      "app_service": {
        "min_instances": 3,
        "max_instances": 8,
        "target_cpu": 65
      },
      "redis": {
        "sku": "Premium",
        "capacity": 1
      }
    },
    "peak_season": {
      "period": "February 1 - April 15",
      "app_service": {
        "min_instances": 5,
        "max_instances": 20,
        "target_cpu": 60
      },
      "redis": {
        "sku": "Premium",
        "capacity": 3
      }
    },
    "post_season": {
      "period": "April 16 - April 30",
      "app_service": {
        "min_instances": 3,
        "max_instances": 8,
        "target_cpu": 70
      },
      "redis": {
        "sku": "Premium",
        "capacity": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Predictive Scaling Implementation

```typescript
// Azure Function for predictive scaling
export const predictiveScaling = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const historicalData = await getHistoricalMetrics();
  const prediction = await generateLoadPrediction(historicalData);

  if (prediction.expectedLoad > currentCapacity * 0.8) {
    await scaleOutResources(prediction.recommendedInstances);
  } else if (prediction.expectedLoad < currentCapacity * 0.3) {
    await scaleInResources(prediction.recommendedInstances);
  }
};
```

### 3. Storage Optimization

#### Blob Storage Tiering Strategy

```json
{
  "storage_lifecycle_policy": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "MoveToIA",
        "type": "Lifecycle",
        "definition": {
          "filters": {
            "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
            "prefixMatch": ["documents/"]
          },
          "actions": {
            "baseBlob": {
              "tierToIA": {
                "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
              },
              "tierToArchive": {
                "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 365
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "DeleteOldLogs",
        "type": "Lifecycle",
        "definition": {
          "filters": {
            "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
            "prefixMatch": ["logs/"]
          },
          "actions": {
            "baseBlob": {
              "delete": {
                "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 2555
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Database Storage Optimization

- **Automated Vacuum**: Schedule during off-peak hours
- **Index Optimization**: Regular analysis and cleanup
- **Archival Strategy**: Move old tax data to cheaper storage after 7 years

### 4. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

#### Recommended Reservations

| Service | Configuration | Term | Savings |
|---------|--------------|------|---------|
| App Service Plan | P1v3 (2 instances) | 3 years | 62% |
| PostgreSQL | GP_Gen5_4 | 1 year | 36% |
| Redis Cache | Premium P1 | 1 year | 30% |

#### Implementation Timeline

1. **Month 1**: Purchase base capacity reservations
2. **Month 2**: Implement auto-scaling with reserved base
3. **Month 3**: Monitor and adjust based on actual usage

### 5. Development and Testing Cost Control

#### Non-Production Environment Optimization

```yaml
# Auto-shutdown schedule for dev/test environments
shutdown_schedule:
  weekdays:
    start: "08:00"
    stop: "19:00"
  weekends:
    enabled: false
  holidays:
    enabled: false

dev_environment:
  app_service_plan: "S1"  # Instead of P1v3
  database: "B_Gen5_1"    # Instead of GP_Gen5_4
  redis: "Basic C0"       # Instead of Premium P1

estimated_savings: "85% reduction in non-prod costs"
```

#### Feature Flag-Based Testing

```typescript
// Reduce costs by using feature flags instead of separate environments
export const featureFlags = {
  enableNewUI: {
    production: false,
    staging: true,
    development: true
  },
  enableAdvancedAnalytics: {
    production: false,
    staging: true,
    development: true
  }
};
```

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting Optimization

#### Cost Alert Configuration

```json
{
  "cost_alerts": [
    {
      "name": "Monthly Budget Alert",
      "threshold": 80,
      "budget": 2000,
      "frequency": "weekly",
      "recipients": ["finance@advisoros.com", "devops@advisoros.com"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Tax Season Budget Alert",
      "threshold": 90,
      "budget": 4000,
      "frequency": "daily",
      "active_period": "January 1 - April 30"
    },
    {
      "name": "Anomaly Detection",
      "threshold": 150,
      "comparison_period": "previous_week",
      "frequency": "daily"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Resource Utilization Monitoring

- **CPU Utilization**: Target 70-80% during business hours
- **Memory Utilization**: Target 80-85% with auto-scaling buffer
- **Database Connections**: Monitor and optimize connection pooling
- **Storage IOPS**: Right-size based on actual usage patterns

### 7. Third-Party Service Optimization

#### API Call Optimization

```typescript
// Cache expensive API calls
export class QuickBooksService {
  private cache = new Map<string, CacheEntry>();
  private readonly CACHE_TTL = 300000; // 5 minutes

  async getCompanyInfo(companyId: string): Promise<CompanyInfo> {
    const cacheKey = `company_${companyId}`;
    const cached = this.cache.get(cacheKey);

    if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.CACHE_TTL) {
      return cached.data;
    }

    const data = await this.quickbooksClient.getCompanyInfo(companyId);
    this.cache.set(cacheKey, { data, timestamp: Date.now() });

    return data;
  }
}
```

#### Email Service Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Group notifications to reduce API calls
- **Template Caching**: Cache email templates to reduce processing
- **Delivery Optimization**: Use local queues for retry logic

### 8. Performance Optimization for Cost Savings

#### CDN Optimization

```json
{
  "cdn_caching_rules": {
    "static_assets": {
      "cache_duration": "1y",
      "compression": true,
      "file_types": ["css", "js", "jpg", "png", "svg", "woff2"]
    },
    "api_responses": {
      "cache_duration": "5m",
      "cache_headers": ["Cache-Control", "ETag"],
      "bypass_patterns": ["/api/auth/*", "/api/upload/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Database Query Optimization

```sql
-- Example of optimized query for tax return listing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_tax_returns_client_year_status
ON app.tax_returns (client_id, tax_year, status)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Materialized view for expensive aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW analytics.tax_season_summary AS
SELECT
    organization_id,
    tax_year,
    COUNT(*) as total_returns,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_returns,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at)) / 3600) as avg_processing_hours
FROM app.tax_returns
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY organization_id, tax_year;

-- Refresh materialized view daily during tax season
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_tax_season_summary()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY analytics.tax_season_summary;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 9. Cost Allocation and Chargeback

#### Resource Tagging Strategy

```json
{
  "tagging_strategy": {
    "required_tags": {
      "Environment": ["dev", "staging", "prod"],
      "CostCenter": ["Development", "Operations", "Business"],
      "Owner": "team@advisoros.com",
      "Project": "advisoros-platform",
      "BillingCode": "ADVISOR-INFRA"
    },
    "business_tags": {
      "Feature": ["core", "integrations", "analytics"],
      "CustomerSegment": ["small", "medium", "enterprise"],
      "Region": ["us-east", "us-west", "global"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cost Allocation Dashboard

```typescript
// Cost allocation report generator
export class CostAllocationService {
  async generateMonthlyCostReport(): Promise<CostReport> {
    const costs = await this.azureCostManagement.getCosts({
      timeframe: 'LastMonth',
      groupBy: ['ResourceGroup', 'Tag:CostCenter', 'Tag:Feature']
    });

    return {
      totalCost: costs.total,
      breakdown: {
        infrastructure: costs.getByTag('CostCenter', 'Operations'),
        development: costs.getByTag('CostCenter', 'Development'),
        business: costs.getByTag('CostCenter', 'Business')
      },
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(costs)
    };
  }

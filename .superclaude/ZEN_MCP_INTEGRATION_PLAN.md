# Zen MCP Server Integration Plan for AdvisorOS
## Enhanced SuperClaude Framework with Professional AI Development Tools

### Executive Summary
Integration of Zen MCP Server with our existing AdvisorOS SuperClaude framework to create a comprehensive AI-powered development environment specifically optimized for multi-tenant CPA platform development.

### Key Benefits
- **Professional Development Tools**: Code review, security auditing, debugging, and testing specifically for CPA workflows
- **Multi-Model AI Support**: Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and local models for complete flexibility
- **Context Preservation**: Advanced conversation continuity beyond token limits using MCP protocol
- **CPA-Specific Workflows**: Custom tools for tax calculations, financial compliance, and multi-tenant security
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Claude Desktop, VS Code, and SuperClaude configuration

   - Knowledge base integration for tax regulations
   - Automated documentation generation for financial processes

### Custom Zen Tools for AdvisorOS

#### 1. Tax Calculation Review Tool
```python
class TaxCalculationReviewTool(WorkflowTool):
    """Multi-step tax calculation validation and optimization"""
    def get_required_actions(self, step_number, confidence, findings, total_steps):
        if step_number == 1:
            return ["Analyze tax calculation logic", "Verify tax code compliance"]
        elif step_number == 2:
            return ["Check edge cases", "Validate against IRS regulations"]
        return ["Generate test cases", "Provide optimization recommendations"]
```

#### 2. Multi-Tenant Security Check Tool
```python
class MultiTenantSecurityCheckTool(WorkflowTool):
    """Comprehensive security audit for multi-tenant CPA platform"""
    def get_required_actions(self, step_number, confidence, findings, total_steps):
        if step_number == 1:
            return ["Verify organizationId filtering", "Check data isolation"]
        elif step_number == 2:
            return ["Audit RBAC implementation", "Validate session security"]
        return ["Test cross-tenant access prevention", "Generate security report"]
```

#### 3. Financial Compliance Audit Tool
```python
class FinancialComplianceAuditTool(WorkflowTool):
    """SOX compliance and financial regulation validation"""
    def get_required_actions(self, step_number, confidence, findings, total_steps):
        if step_number == 1:
            return ["Check audit trail implementation", "Verify data retention"]
        elif step_number == 2:
            return ["Validate financial controls", "Check compliance reporting"]
        return ["Generate compliance documentation", "Identify improvement areas"]
```

# ⚡ ACTION REQUIRED - PostgreSQL Installation

**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Status**: Waiting for user action
**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

## 🚨 What You Need To Do RIGHT NOW

PostgreSQL is not installed on your system. **Everything is blocked until this is complete.**

### ✅ Easiest Option: Automated Installation

**Open PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
# Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
# (Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator")

# Step 2: Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\MarkusAhling\AdvisorOS\AdvisorOS

# Step 3: Run automated installation
.\scripts\install-postgres-windows.ps1

# That's it! Script handles everything automatically:
# - Installs PostgreSQL 15
# - Creates database
# - Configures user
# - Updates .env file
# - Tests connection
```

**Time**: 10-15 minutes (mostly automated)

**What happens**:
- ✅ PostgreSQL 15 installed via Chocolatey
- ✅ Database `advisoros_dev` created
- ✅ User `advisoros` configured
- ✅ `.env` file updated automatically
- ✅ Connection tested

---

## 📋 What Happens After Installation

Once PostgreSQL is installed, **immediately run**:

```bash
# Test connection (should pass)
npm run dev:test

# Run migration (creates 38 tables)
cd apps\web
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_fractional_cfo_marketplace_models

# Generate Prisma Client (TypeScript types)
npx prisma generate

# Verify everything (opens browser)
npx prisma studio
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ 38 database tables created
- ✅ 8 new marketplace models (advisor_profiles, etc.)
- ✅ Prisma Studio shows all tables
- ✅ Ready to begin development

---

## 🎯 Why This Is Critical

**Currently Blocked**:
- ❌ Cannot run migrations
- ❌ Cannot generate Prisma Client
- ❌ Cannot start development server
- ❌ Cannot implement any features
- ❌ All Week 1 tasks blocked

**After Installation**:
- ✅ Can execute migrations
- ✅ Can start development
- ✅ Can implement authentication
- ✅ Can build service layer
- ✅ Week 1 unblocked

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**Error: "script is not digitally signed"**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Error: "Chocolatey not found"**
- Script installs it automatically
- Just wait for installation to complete

**Error: "Access denied"**
- Make sure PowerShell is running as Administrator
- Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator"

**Other Issues**:
- Check [INSTALL_POSTGRES.md](./INSTALL_POSTGRES.md) for troubleshooting
- Try manual installation option
- Review [DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
